Appearance[edit | edit source]
3D dropped items, both blocks and strict items.
Items have two possible appearances, generally corresponding to whether the item appears as a 3D or 2D shape in a player's inventory screens. 3D items appear as their 3D shape, miniaturized to about 1⁄4 scale, while 2D items appear as 1⁄2 scale with all the pixels extruded into a cube. Both types slowly rotate and bob up and down; this is merely a visual effect, the item itself does not actually rotate or bob up and down.
Item entities that represent a stack of more than one item appear as several items stuck together. Stacks of 1 appear as one item, 2-16 as two items, 17–32 as three, 33-48 as four, and 49+ as five.
The rotation rate of the item is approximately 2.87675 degrees per tick, or 57.595 degrees per second.
Behavior[edit | edit source]
Item entities come from many sources. Some common ones are:
The death of a mob or player.
A block that is mined by a player, destroyed by an explosion, or washed away by water.
An inventory item tossed by pressing the drop item key (default Q on PC, on Xbox, / on Nintendo Switch, on PlayStation) or dragging a stack outside of an inventory window.
In the mobile versions of Bedrock Edition, items in the hotbar can be dropped by pressing on the item's slot. The entire stack is dropped.
A container (other than an ender chest or a shulker box) that is destroyed while holding items inside.
The player may be thought of as having an ""item pickup"" box that surrounds their hitbox. This pickup box extends 1 additional block to the horizontal sides, and 0.5 additional blocks up and down. Any item whose hitbox intersects with the pickup box can be picked up. The pickup box is inclusive on the horizontal sides (for distance less than or equal to 1), and exclusive on the vertical sides (distance less than 0.5). When the player's hitbox size changes, such as when crouching or sleeping, the pickup box size changes with it.
Once an item entity's hitbox overlaps with the player's pickup box, it can transfer its items. As many items as can fit in the player inventory, excluding the armor slots and the off-hand slot, are transferred. If any item is transferred, a ""plopping"" sound is played. If all items are transferred, the items appear to move into the center of the player. The item entity never physically moves, however, which means it can appear to go through lava and blocks in its path. This can happen through blocks that are thinner than a full block, but also through the shared edge of two full blocks. Unlike experience orbs, multiple item entities can be picked up simultaneously. Dropped items have a delay of 10 ticks (half a second) between appearing and being able to be picked up, or 40 ticks (2 seconds) if thrown by a player, dolphin, or fox.
Items do not collide with other entities (except boats) and are only moved or stopped by blocks.
Like other entities, items can be pushed by flowing water and bubble columns, pushed by a piston, launched by a moving slime block, stuck to a honey block, or caught in a cobweb. Items move at faster speeds if ice is placed under the flowing water. When in still water, items float slowly up to the surface.
In Java Edition, items can be reeled by fishing rods, costing 3 durability.
If an item is within a solid block, it then flies out one of the unobstructed sides, or out of the top of the block if surrounded by solid blocks on all sides. It does this even if the space below is unoccupied; therefore, it is possible to recover an item dropped by breaking a hole in a floor by quickly placing another block there.
Items visually disappear when the player is about 16 blocks away from them, and reappear when they get closer. In Java Edition, this distance can be adjusted by the ""Entity Distance"" slider in video settings.
Unlike most entities, items cannot be spectated in Spectator mode without use of the /spectate command.
When an item entity drops within the pickup box of two separate players simultaneously on a multiplayer server, the player who joined first automatically gets the item. If the item is tossed by one of said players, the other player is prioritized.[verify]
Merging[edit | edit source]
Two stackable items of the same type can merge together into a single item entity if the resulting stack size does not exceed that item's maximum stack size and if they are within a 0.5 x 0.25 x 0.5 square bounding box around the other item.
When this happens the item with the largest stack size gets its item count increased while the other is despawned, if the item count is the same the item that is processed first is the one that will be removed.
Items normally attempt to merge every 40 game ticks (2 seconds), however items moving across block boundaries can be processed every 2 ticks (0.1 s).
Damage[edit | edit source]
Items cannot be attacked by players or mobs; attempting to do so simply hits through them. However, they take damage and disappear from environmental or block-based damage such as explosions, fire, lava, and contact with cacti. Items have essentially no health, so they are destroyed by the slightest damage, though if set on fire they may remain for a few seconds before disappearing. Nether stars are immune to explosions, and netherite-based items and tools are immune to fire and float on top of lava. Also, some blocks that normally damage mobs, such as magma blocks, campfires, sweet berry bushes, wither roses and powder snow, do not damage items.
Despawning[edit | edit source]
Items despawn after 6000 game ticks (5 minutes) of being in a loaded, entity-ticking chunk; this is affected by the player's simulation distance. If two item stacks merge, the timer is set to the item that has more time remaining. The 5-minute timer is paused when the chunk is unloaded or no longer processing entities. In Bedrock Edition, nether stars do not despawn. In Java Edition, nether stars dropped by a dying wither despawn after 10 minutes, but they despawn after 5 minutes if dropped by any other means.
Items that fall into the void immediately despawn when they fall below world minumum height - 64 so Y=-128 in the Overworld, Y=-64 in the Nether and the End.
Sounds[edit | edit source]
Java Edition:
Item Entities use the Ambient/Environment sound category for entity-dependent sound events.

Tags common to all entities[show]
[Short] Age: The number of ticks the item has been ""untouched"". After 6000 ticks (5 minutes) the item is destroyed. If set to -32768, the Age does not increase, preventing the item from despawning automatically.
[Short] Health: The health of the item, which starts at 5. Items take damage from fire, lava, cacti and explosions. The item is destroyed when its health reaches 0.
[NBT Compound / JSON Object] Item: The inventory item, without the Slot tag.
Tags common to all items[show]
[Int Array] Owner: If present, only the player with this UUID can pick up the item. Used by the give command (and can be set in a summon command) to prevent the wrong player from picking up the spawned item entity. Is not preserved when removed.[upcoming JE 1.21.5]
[Short] PickupDelay: The number of ticks the item cannot be picked up. Decreases by 1 per tick. If set to 32767, the PickupDelay does not decrease, preventing the item from being picked up.

Sifat[edit source]
Sebagian barang, ketika Pemain menekan tombol ""gunakan"", akan meletakkan versi balok (ItemBlock) atau entitas (Kereta Tambang, Telur Pijah, dsj.) diri mereka sendiri di dunia dalam gim. Singkatnya: menjadi barang ketika dalam persediaan, dan menjadi balok ketika diletakkan. Misalnya, perahu berubah menjadi entitas ketika diletakkan, dan kasur menjadi kelompok balok. Ketika terpilih di baris AMP (Antarmuka Pengguna, bahasa Inggris: hotbar), barang akan menampilkan nama dirinya dalam waktu singkat di atas baris tersebut.
Satu-satunya cara menampilkan yang tepat suatu barang dalam lingkungan dunia gim ialah dengan menempatkannya di Bingkai Barang.
Jika suatu barang yang tidak menjadi balok dijatuhkan, barang tersebut akan menjadi entitas, diwakili oleh sprite yang mengambang di atas suatu permukaan di dalam bingkah-bingkah yang termuat selama 5 menit sebelum barang itu menghilang, kecuali ada pemain berjalan melewatinya untuk mengambil sebelum barang tersebut menghilang, atau barang itu diambil oleh satu makhluk, corong atau kereta tambang bercorong, atau dihanguskan oleh api, lahar, Kaktus, atau ledakan.
Barang yang terbenam akan mengambang menuju permukaan air. Bila air itu berarus, barang akan hanyut mengikutinya.
Corong menghisap semua barang yang berada di atasnya.
Penumpukan[edit source]
Barang bisa ditumpuk 64 buah, 16 buah, atau tidak bisa sama sekali:
Sebagian besar barang dapat bertumpuk 64 buah. Termasuk di dalam golongan ini seluruh jenis balok, dan barang lain-lain.
Beberapa lain, seperti Bola Salju, Ember kosong, Telur, Tanda dan Mutiara Ender bisa bertumpuk paling banyak 16 buah.
Sebagian lain tidak bertumpuk sama sekali, umumnya yang memiliki umur pakai (Senjata, Zirah serta Alat, Ember berisi, dan Ramuan).
Semua barang sebenarnya secara teknis bisa dipaksa bertumpuk sampai 127 memakai perintah, meski tidak tampil sama sekali di permainan.

Barang dengan kegunaan di dunia[edit source]

Appearance[edit | edit source]
The texture of a very fine item resembles the side face of a grass block with the words ""Home Sweet Home"" written on it. Unlike most items, its texture is 64×64 pixels, rather than the usual 16×16.
Obtaining[edit | edit source]
Dimension[edit | edit source]
A very fine item can only be obtained from an item frame in the isolation dimension, at 0,0 there is a house called ""house of bob"" in the files. A very fine item can only be found in an item frame on the second floor. There is a maximum of 1 fine item that can be found legitimately in any world since there is only one house of bob.
Cheats/Creative mode[edit | edit source]
This item can't be found in the Creative inventory, but it can be middle-click duplicated in Creative mode or given with the /give <target> minecraft:fine_item <amount> command.
Usage[edit | edit source]
This item cannot be placed or used in any way other than a trophy. It can still be inserted and/or rotated inside of an item frame.

Mining[edit | edit source]
An amethyst cluster, mined using a pickaxe without Silk Touch or Fortune enchantments, drops 4 amethyst shards. When mined using any other tool, item, or mechanism (such as explosions or pistons) it drops 2 shards. The maximum amount of amethyst shards dropped can be increased with Fortune. Fortune I gives a 1⁄3 chance for 8 shards, averaging 5.33 shards; Fortune II gives a 25% chance (each) to give 8 or 12 shards, averaging 7 shards; and Fortune III gives a 20% chance (each) to give 8, 12, or 16 shards, averaging 8.8 shards.
If an amethyst cluster in any of its growth stages is mined using a pickaxe enchanted with Silk Touch, it drops itself rather than amethyst shards.

Usage[edit | edit source]
Ankle monitors are equipped in the boots slot. They cannot be taken off in survival mode, similarly to items afflicted with the yet to be added Curse of Binding.
While wearing an ankle monitor during the night (between 12541 and 23458, or 18:30 and 5:30 according to the Smarter Watch), being more than 50 blocks from the player's spawn point afflicts the player with Slowness I for 14 seconds and prompts the following message in chat: ""CURFEW WARNING! You are violating your house arrest! Get back by [distance] meters!"" The message is displayed again and the effect is reapplied every 10 seconds until the player get back into the 50 block radius.
If in the Nether or the End, the player is afflicted with Slowness I and a different set of messages is cycled through, which can be seen in the section below. The effect is reapplied and the messages are displayed every 9 seconds
Nether and End messages[edit | edit source]
CURFEW WARNING! You are violating your house arrest! Uuuh... where are you anyway?
CURFEW WARNING! Hello, are you there?
CURFEW WARNING! I'm sure you have important things to do, but you need to go back!
CURFEW WARNING! We're lonely back home!
CURFEW WARNING! By ""we"" I mean I. I'm lonely.
CURFEW WARNING! Ok enough games... GET BACK RIGHT NOW!
CURFEW WARNING! LAST WARNING!
CURFEW WARNING! LASTEST WARNING (really now)
CURFEW WARNING! ...
CURFEW WARNING! So... Where are you?
CURFEW WARNING! Having a good day?
CURFEW WARNING! Did you see that monster over there?
CURFEW WARNING! Give it a whack, if you would be so kind.
CURFEW WARNING! Teheee...
CURFEW WARNING! Ok, enough of this!
CURFEW WARNING! Last straw!
CURFEW WARNING! Now you die.
CURFEW WARNING! Boom!
CURFEW WARNING! Hehe, fun right?
CURFEW WARNING! Ok, you will not hear anything more from me now!
CURFEW WARNING! You'll be as lonely as I am.
CURFEW WARNING! How does that feel?
CURFEW WARNING! I know, I'll wipe my memory. That way, I can start over!

Turtle Shell Turtle Scute


A full set of leather, iron, golden, or diamond armor requires 24 units of a given material to craft. Netherite armor cannot be crafted directly, and is obtained by upgrading diamond armor in a smithing table. A turtle shell is a type of helmet, but no other armor items can be crafted from turtle scutes. Chainmail armor is uncraftable, and can be obtained only from mob drops, trading with villagers, or buried treasure.‌[Bedrock Edition only]
Upgrading[edit | edit source]
Netherite armor is obtained by upgrading diamond armor in a smithing table. Each piece of netherite armor requires a netherite ingot and a netherite upgrade smithing template. A full set of netherite armor requires 4 netherite ingots and 4 netherite upgrade smithing templates.
Netherite armor retains the enchantments, prior work penalty, and number of durability points lost (instead of the remaining durability) from the diamond armor.

Natural generation[edit | edit source]
Two armor stands are found in each taiga village outdoor armory, one equipped with an iron helmet, the other with an iron chestplate.
Generated loot[edit | edit source]
Helmets[show]
Chestplates[show]
Leggings[show]
Boots[show]
In Bedrock Edition, a sealed room in woodland mansions can appear that has a chest always containing a chainmail boots piece enchanted with Efficiency I.[1].
Mob loot[edit | edit source]
Zombies, skeletons, and their variants that spawn with armor have a small chance of dropping their armor when killed by the player. The dropped armor has a random durability and retains any enchantments it has. Upon death, zombies, zombie villagers, Drowned, skeletons, zombified piglins, and wither skeletons always drop any armor that they picked up and equipped.
In Bedrock Edition, pillagers and vindicators that spawn in raids have a small chance to drop an iron helmet, iron chestplate, iron leggings, or iron boots, in a badly damaged state, with a possibility of having a random enchantment.
In Java Edition, armorer villagers throw chainmail armor to players who have the Hero of the Village status effect.
Trading[edit | edit source]
Main article: Trading
Leather armor can be bought from leatherworker villagers. These armor pieces have randomly determined color.
Iron armor, chainmail armor and enchanted diamond armor can be bought from armorer villagers.
Bartering[edit | edit source]
Piglins may barter iron boots enchanted with Soul Speed when given a gold ingot.
Fishing[edit | edit source]
Leather boots, often badly damaged, can be obtained as a junk item from fishing.
Usage[edit | edit source]
Armor can be worn by a player or mob in order to protect them. See § Mechanics for more details.
Equipping[edit | edit source]
A player can equip a piece of armor on themself by using it in the main hand (or off hand in Java Edition) by placing it in the correct slot in their inventory, or by dispensing it from a dispenser onto themself.
Armor slots
Item Correct slot
Helmet, Cap, Shell, Mob Head, or Carved Pumpkin Head
Chestplate, Tunic, or Elytra Chest
Leggings or Pants Legs
Boots Feet
If the armor's respective slot already contains a piece of armor, they are swapped, and the original armor ends up in the player's hand.
A chestplate provides the most protection per unit of material, followed by leggings. For leather, iron, and diamond armor, boots have equivalent armor points as the helmet, but for chainmail and gold armor, the helmet trumps boots. A turtle shell, in addition to providing protection, also gives the player the Water Breathing status effect.
Each armor piece fills one inventory slot, and armor pieces cannot be stacked.
Mob interactions[edit | edit source]
General
Wearing a mob head in the helmet armor slot reduces the distance the corresponding mob detects the player by 50%.
Endermen
A player wearing a carved pumpkin in the helmet slot does not aggravate endermen.
Piglins
While the player is wearing at least one piece of gold armor, piglins behave as neutral mobs instead of hostile. Piglin brutes do not become neutral and remain hostile.
Block interactions[edit | edit source]
Powder snow
Mobs are immune to freezing in powdered snow while wearing at least one piece of leather armor. Mobs do not sink in powder snow while wearing leather boots, and the player can move through the powder snow like scaffolding.
Magma blocks and campfires
A player wearing boots enchanted with Frost Walker does not take damage while walking on magma blocks or campfires.
Repairing[edit | edit source]
Armor can be repaired by placing two pieces of the same type (e.g., iron helmets) in a grindstone or in the crafting grid. The resulting item has 5% more durability left than the original items combined, but any enchantments are lost. If the total durability of both of the armor pieces is more than the total durability that a piece of armor would have fresh from a crafting table, the extra durability is lost. Repairing armor with an anvil preserves and combines the enchantments, with a rising experience cost for subsequent repairs on the same item.
Unit repair[edit | edit source]
Main article: Anvil mechanics § Unit repair
A piece of armor can be repaired in an anvil by adding units of the armor material's repair material, with each repair material restoring 25% of the armor item's maximum durability, rounded down. Chainmail armor can be repaired in an anvil using iron ingots. Netherite armor can be repaired in an anvil using netherite ingots.
Grinding[edit | edit source]
2 pieces of armor can be grinded together in order to repair them.
Ingredients Grinding recipe

Description
Two matching armor pieces
The durability of the two armor pieces is added together, plus an extra 5% durability.

Description
An enchanted armor piece
The enchantments on the armor are removed, but curses are not. This does not change the armor's durability or name.
The icons do not have enchantments because invicons for them have not been added yet.
Enchanted armor can be grinded with unenchanted armor, as long as they both have the same type (i.e. shape and material), which results in disenchanting the enchanted armor and then combining the 2 items together in the same process. 2 enchanted pieces of armor can also be disenchanted and combined in this way (as long as they both have the same type).
Dyeing leather armor[edit | edit source]
Main article: Dye § Dyeing armor
In Java Edition, leather armor can be dyed by crafting it together with 1 or more dyes.
In Bedrock Edition, leather armor can be dyed by using it on a cauldron filled with dyed water. This consumes 1 layer of water but does not change the color of the water.
Dyed leather armor also be undyed by using it on a cauldron with undyed water. This changes the water's color to the color of the armor's dye, and changes the leather armor to have no dye color.
Default color HEX code for leather armor is
 #A06540.
Armor trims[edit | edit source]
Main article: Smithing § Trimming
Armor can be given trims using an armor trim smithing template, a trim material and any armor piece. Trimmed armor has different patterns and different colors depending on the template and material used.

Mob armor[edit | edit source]
Armor equipped on mobs[edit | edit source]
Some mobs have a chance to spawn with armor equipped. When a mob spawns with armor, the number of pieces of armor, the type of armor pieces, and whether the armor is enchanted, depends on the difficulty; although, the tier of armor (leather, gold, etc.) has a fixed probability. Mobs can spawn with trimmed armor only from trial spawners. Some mobs also spawn with the ability to pick up armor on the ground and equip it.
Armor Type Chance
Leather 37.06%
Gold 48.73%
Chainmail 12.90%
Iron 1.27%
Diamond 0.04%
It is impossible for zombies and skeletons to naturally spawn with netherite armor.
The protection provided by armor and armor enchantments works the same with mobs as it does with players.
The following mobs can spawn with armor:
Zombie
Baby Zombie
Zombie Villager‌[JE only]
Baby Zombie Villager‌[JE only]
Husk

Fox‌[BE only]
Baby Fox‌[BE only]
This mob can have armor equipped on it via a dispenser, and the armor does render, but this mob cannot pick up the armor:
Piglin Brute
These mobs can have armor equipped on them via a dispenser‌[Java Edition only][3] or via commands, but the armor does not render, and these mobs cannot pick up the armor:
Villager
Baby Villager
These mobs do not spawn with armor and it cannot be equipped in survival mode, but if equipped with commands, their armor is visible:
Giant‌[Java Edition only]
Pillager‌[Bedrock Edition only]
Vindicator‌[Bedrock Edition only]
Evoker‌[Bedrock Edition only]
All other mobs can be equipped with armor via commands, but the armor cannot be seen.
A helmet protects a mob that burns in sunlight from burning, but this depletes the helmet's durability as it absorbs the damage. Eventually, the helmet loses all of its durability and breaks, and then the mob burns in the sunlight. A carved pumpkin, mob head, or anything placed into the head slot using commands, can also protect the mob from burning in sunlight.
Damage caused by any other source does not cause a mob's armor durability to decrease, unless the armor is horse armor or wolf armor.

Wolf armor[edit | edit source]
Main article: Wolf Armor
Wolf armor can be equipped on a tamed wolf to protect it from most forms of damage. Wolf armor does not work like player armor. Instead, it absorbs all damage it protects against, and decreases its durability by the number of points of damage absorbed.
Mechanics[edit | edit source]
In-game, ""armor points"" are just referred to as ""armor"" (e.g. in the tooltip shown when hovering over the item), but the term ""armor points"" is being used in this article to differentiate between the game mechanic and armor items.
Each piece of armor has two values associated with it: armor points, and armor toughness. The number of armor points or armor toughness the player has is the sum of the armor points or armor toughness of the individual pieces of armor.
The amount of damage that armor reduces depends on the total armor points and armor toughness the player has, and on the strength of the incoming damage. Armor becomes less effective as the amount of damage increases. That is, armor reduces a smaller percent of damage for larger damage values. For example, a full set of diamond armor reduces the damage of a zombie's attack by 77% (3HP damage to 0.69HP × 0.345 damage), but reduces the attack damage of a piglin brute by only 67% (13HP × 6.5 damage to 4.29HP × 2.145 damage). There is a minimum amount of damage that armor protects against (20% of the maximum damage reduction) that depends on the total number of armor points (not armor toughness).
Armor is an attribute modifier and temporarily increases two attributes of the player or mob wearing the armor: armor and armor_toughness. These attributes can also be modified with commands, and the player or mob takes a reduced amount of damage as if they were wearing armor with the same total armor points and armor toughness.
The maximum possible damage reduction from armor alone is 80%. Damage can further be reduced by up to 80% from enchantments, and up to an additional 80% by effects (excluding resistance V). Through armor, enchantments, and effects, the maximum possible damage reduction is 99.2%.
Base protection of each full set of armor by tier
Tier Minimum Maximum
Leather 5.6% 28%
Golden 8.8% 44%
Chainmail 9.6% 48%
Iron 12% 60%
Diamond 16% 80%
Netherite 16% 80%
Damage types[edit | edit source]
The following types of damage are reduced by armor and, consequently, damage the armor itself:
Direct (melee) attacks from mobs and players. This includes the Strength and the Weakness effects and damage-increasing enchantments.
Getting hit with an arrow, a shulker bullet or a thrown trident. This includes extra damage from enchantments (except shulker bullets).
Getting hit with a fireball from a ghast or blaze, or a fire charge.
Laser beam of a guardian or an elder guardian.
Damage from Thorns enchantment, or spikes of guardians and elder guardians.
Touching a damaging block (fire, lava, magma block, cactus or sweet berry bush).
This excludes netherite armor which is not damaged by fire-related sources.
Touching a pufferfish.
Explosions.
Fireworks with at least a firework star in the recipe.
Lightning.
Getting hit with a falling anvil.
Getting hit with a snowball from a player[upcoming JE Combat Tests] or snow golem.[more information needed]
Getting hit with an egg from a player[upcoming JE Combat Tests][more information needed]
The following types of damage are not reduced by armor and have no effect on the armor itself:
Ranged sonic boom attacks from wardens.
Fall damage (including ender pearls, but Protection and Feather Falling enchantments reduce it).
Ongoing damage from being on fire.
Suffocating inside a block or due to entity cramming (also includes the world border)‌[JE only].
Drowning in water (partially for turtle shells).
Starvation.
Colliding with a block while flying with elytra.
Magic (Evoker fangs, status effects and instant damage from a potion of Harming or Dragon's Breath) (but Protection does reduce magical damage.)
Falling into the void or /kill.
Being inside of a powder snow block.
This excludes if the player or mob wears any piece of leather armor.
Armor points[edit | edit source]
The armor bar as shown in game
The total number of armor points that player has is the sum of the armor points of the individual pieces of armor worn, and is visually represented by the armor bar. The armor increases the player's armor attribute while worn. Armor points determine the minimum amount of damage armor reduces. See Damage reduction below to see how damage reduction is calculated.
The armor attribute is capped at 30. If commands are used to give the player armor with more than 30 armor points, or to set the player's armor attribute above 30, damage is calculated as if the player had 30 armor points. The armor bar does not show armor points above 20.
The following table shows the number of armor points provided by each type of armor that can be worn by the player.

Turtle Shell 2 () 2 () N/A N/A N/A
Leather 7 () 1 () 3 () 2 () 1 ()
Golden 11 ( × 5.5) 2 () 5 () 3 () 1 ()

Diamond 20 ( × 10) 3 () 8 () 6 () 3 ()
Netherite 20 ( × 10) 3 () 8 () 6 () 3 ()
Armor toughness[edit | edit source]
Armor becomes less effective for higher damage values, reducing the damage by smaller and smaller percentages. Armor toughness mitigates this behavior to a degree. The amount of damage reduced still decreases for higher damage values, but not as much. The total number of armor toughness the player has is the sum of the armor toughness of the individual pieces of armor worn. Armor toughness does not have a visual indicator like armor points. Armor increases the player's armor_toughness attribute while worn. See Damage reduction below to see how armor toughness affects damage calculation.
Currently, only diamond and netherite armor have armor toughness.
The armor_toughness attribute is capped at 20. If commands are used to give the player armor with more than 20 armor toughness, or to set the player's armor_toughness attribute above 20, damage is calculated as if the player has 20 armor toughness.
The following table shows the amount of armor toughness given by armor that can be worn by the player.

These damage values are lower if a player wears pieces of diamond or netherite armor or has toughness added to the armor through commands.
Knockback reduction[edit | edit source]
Each netherite armor piece gives a knockback resistance (or reduction) of 10%, protecting 40% of all knockback with a full set.
Enchantments[edit | edit source]
See also: Enchanting
Armor can be enchanted to provide various benefits. Enchantments can provide more protection or allow armor to resist certain types of damage that armor doesn't normally protect against, such as fall damage or fire. Damage reduction from enchantments does not decrease the armor's durability. Armor enchantments do not appear on the armor bar.
An armor's material determines how enchantable it is. The higher a material's enchantability, the greater the chances of getting multiple and high-level enchantments.

As with several enchantments, several different levels of protection are possible. The maximum level of a protection enchantment is currently IV (4). Protection enchantments from multiple pieces of armor stack together, up to a calculated maximum.
Each protection enchantment protects against specific types of damage. The amount of damage reduction depends on the Enchantment Protection Factor (EPF) provided by that enchantment.
Enchantment Damage reduced for Type Modifier EPF
Level I EPF
Level II EPF
Level III EPF
Level IV
Protection All 1 1 2 3 4
Fire Protection Fire, lava, and blaze fireballs 2 2 4 6 8
Blast Protection Explosions 2 2 4 6 8
Projectile Protection Arrows, thrown tridents, ghast and blaze fireballs 2 2 4 6 8
Feather Falling Fall damage (including ender pearls) 3 3 6 9 12
When a player or mob wearing armor is subjected to damage, the EPFs of all applicable enchantments are added together, capped at 20, and then damage reduction is cappedEPF / 25, giving a maximum reduction of 20⁄25 (80%) at EPF 20.
Because of the caps in the calculation, it is possible to achieve maximum protection against specific types of damage with just three pieces of armor. For example, two pieces of armor with Blast Protection IV (EPF 8 each) and a single piece with Protection IV (EPF 4) would give a total EPF of 20 versus explosions. Any additional EPF would be wasted against explosions (but might be useful against other types of damage, if applicable).
If the damage is of a type that armor protects against normally, this reduction applies only to the damage that got through the armor.
It is possible using /give to obtain armor with an enchantment level higher than what is normally obtainable via normal survival. Using this method, a player could give themselves, for example, a full set of diamond armor with a Protection V enchantment on every piece. Following the algorithm above, we find that, because Protection V has an EPF of 5, the armor reaches the maximum EPF of 20 for all types of damage. Any higher Protection enchantments could be used to reach the cap with just one level XX (20) enchantment, rather than having a full set of enchanted armor, but would be wasted if all pieces shared the same level enchantment.
The table below shows all armor enchantments at their max levels:
Armor Enchantments at Max Levels
Armor Enchantment Max Level
Protection IV
Fire Protection
Blast Protection
Projectile Protection
Feather Falling
Respiration III
Thorns
Depth Strider
Unbreaking
Soul Speed
Swift Sneak
Frost Walker II
Aqua Affinity I
Mending
Curse of Binding
Curse of Vanishing
Only one form of protection can be applied to a piece of armor (i.e. a chestplate cannot have both Fire Protection and Blast Protection, unless using commands to get all protection enchants in one piece of armor). Feather Falling, Frost Walker, Depth Strider and Soul Speed are enchantments applicable only to boots. Respiration and Aqua Affinity are enchantments applicable only to helmets. Swift Sneak is enchantment applicable only to leggings.
Durability[edit | edit source]
Any hit from a damage source that can be blocked by armor removes one point of durability from each piece of armor worn for every 4HP of incoming damage (rounded down, but never below 1). The following chart displays how many hits each piece of armor can endure.
Material Helmet Chestplate Leggings Boots
Turtle Shell 275 N/A N/A N/A
Leather 55 80 75 65
Golden 77 112 105 91
Chainmail 165 240 225 195
Iron 165 240 225 195
Diamond 363 528 495 429
Netherite 407 592 555 481
The chart below shows the durability per unit of material for each piece of armor, compared to that of the boots. The durability per unit does not depend on the tier of the armor.
Helmet Chestplate Leggings Boots
Durability/Unit 68% 61% 66% 100%
This means that for the same number of leather/iron ingots/gold ingots/chainmail/diamond, boots can take 1.5 more damage than leggings. Thus, chestplates and leggings offer more defense points per unit, but have less durability per unit.
This other chart shows the durability of each piece of armor in a set, as a percentage of the chestplate's durability. Additionally, the maximum durability of the chestplate is always a multiple of 16, leggings a multiple of 15, boots a multiple of 13, and helmets a multiple of 11.
Helmet Chestplate Leggings Boots
Durability percentage 68.75% 100% 93.75% 81.25%
Armor worn by a non-player mob does not lose durability when attacked by any means. Helmets that are worn by undead mobs lose durability when exposed to sunlight due to absorbing the mob's damage from sunlight.
Netherite armor does not lose durability from lava or fire damage.

Obtaining[edit | edit source]
Breaking[edit | edit source]
An armor stand can be broken by quickly attacking it twice, causing it to drop itself and any armor or item placed onto it. Players in Adventure mode cannot break armor stands.[1] Using an axe costs two durability, with no additional benefit.
In Bedrock Edition, if an armor stand is killed by a harming potion while holding a totem of undying, then the armor stand revives instead of dropping the totem, as with any mob holding a totem of undying.
Natural generation[edit | edit source]
Two armor stands are found in each taiga village outdoor armory, one equipped with an iron helmet and the other with an iron chestplate.‌[JE only]

Usage[edit | edit source]
Players can use armor stands to hold armor, mob heads, carved pumpkins, and elytra, or other items and blocks if it has arms. The stand does not have a GUI, so players interact with it directly. Armor stands can be placed in 8 different orientations. Armor stands cannot be placed if there is not enough room (i.e. the space is occupied by other entities or solid blocks).
Despite being inanimate, armor stands are living entities, allowing them to be pushed by pistons, moved by flowing water, pulled with fishing rods, pushed by attacks that inflict knockback, and bounced by slime blocks.
Equipping armor[edit | edit source]
Using armor on a stand places the armor in the appropriate slot; if the slot is already equipped with armor, the old armor is swapped with the armor held by the player. Pressing the use control on armor with a bare hand removes the armor and places it in the highlighted hotbar slot.
Equipping items[edit | edit source]
In Bedrock Edition, armor stands have arms by default; in Java Edition, arms can be made visible only by setting the NBT tag {ShowArms: 1b} via commands or external editors. Pressing the use control on an armor stand with arms while holding a non-equippable item places it in its main hand. In Java Edition, shields are always placed in the off-hand instead. If the armor stand already holds an item, it is swapped with the item held by the player.
Items from an armor stand's main hand can be retrieved by pressing the use control in any empty spot in Java Edition, or from the chestplate zone if empty in Bedrock Edition. In Java Edition, items in the off-hand slot can be retrieved only if the main hand slot is empty; in Bedrock Edition items in the off-hand slot cannot be retrieved unless the armor stand is broken.
In Java Edition, commands can be used to equip items in an armor stand's hands even if its arms are not visible.
Dispensers[edit | edit source]
In Java Edition, dispensers can place armor stands. Dispensers ignore the normal placement rules of armor stands - this means they can place armor stands inside solid blocks, or if the needed space is occupied by other entities.
Armor, mob heads, carved pumpkins, or elytra can be automatically placed on armor stands with a dispenser. Unlike players, dispensers cannot swap armor or items already equipped on the armor stand. Additionally, dispensers can equip shields in an armor stand's off-hand if it has arms; in Bedrock Edition, this is the only way to equip shields in the off-hand slot without using commands.
Posing[edit | edit source]
This feature is exclusive to Bedrock Edition. 
In Bedrock Edition, the pose of the armor stand can be changed by interacting with the armor stand (or pressing the Pose button on mobile devices) while sneaking, or by using a redstone signal. There are 13 possible poses.

Naming[edit | edit source]
Upside-down armor stands in Bedrock Edition
Using a renamed name tag on an armor stand gives it a custom name. In Java Edition, the name is not displayed by default,[2] while in Bedrock Edition it is displayed similarly to renamed mobs. In Java Edition, armor stands can also be given custom names by renaming them at an anvil. In Java Edition, a renamed armor stand keeps its custom name when broken. In Bedrock Edition, armor stands named ""Dinnerbone"" or ""Grumm"" turn upside-down.
Further customization[edit | edit source]
Armor stands that have been customized with commands in Java Edition (from left to right: arms, no base plate, small, invisible, custom pose)
Commands, such as /item in Java Edition or /replaceitem in Bedrock Edition, can be used to give armor stands items that normally cannot be equipped in armor or hand slots. In maps that heavily use command blocks, armor stands can be used to keep scoreboard objectives that are 'global' to the map, run commands, etc.
In Java Edition, armor stands can be customized further to have arms, pose, disobey gravity, dual wield, and other things by summoning them using /summon with customized NBT tags. For example, it is possible to create an armor stand with arms using the /summon command. It is also possible to change an armor stand without arms into a stand with arms by using the /data command. The commands are as follows:
/data merge entity @e[type=armor_stand,sort=nearest,limit=1] {ShowArms:1}, which changes the nearest armor stand into an armor stand with arms.
/summon minecraft:armor_stand ~ ~ ~ {ShowArms:1}, which summons a new armor stand with arms shown.
/summon minecraft:armor_stand ~ ~ ~ {Rotation:[0.0f]}, which summons a new armor stand that faces a desired direction (dependent on changing ""0.0f"" to other numbers like ""90.0f"" or ""180.0f"", otherwise it faces the same way as a default armor stand).
/data merge entity @e[type=armor_stand,sort=nearest,limit=1] {ShowArms:1,Pose:{LeftArm:[0f,0f,0f],RightArm:[0f,0f,0f]}}, which changes the ortientation of the arms of the nearest armor stand (the default orientation of the left arm is: [350f,0f,350f] and [345f,0f,10f] for the right arm).
Other examples of customization include removing the stone plate below the armor stand, or giving the armor stand a small size (roughly the same size and proportions as a baby zombie).
Behavior[edit | edit source]
An armor stand affected by a night vision potion in Bedrock Edition
An armor stand being damaged by the Wither effect potion in Bedrock Edition
Because armor stands are entities, they obey gravity, allowing them to fall and rest on non-full blocks such as enchanting tables, snow layers and slabs. Armor stands can't be leashed and can't ride on boats, but in Bedrock Edition, they can sit on minecarts.
Armor stands wobble slightly when hit by the player. They are not damaged by cacti and sweet berry bushes, but can be broken by arrows and tridents. An armor stand destroyed by an explosion or a firework rocket does not drop as an item. Armor stands in water and lava at the same time are not consumed by the lava.
Being living entities, armor stands can also have attributes added to them and can be affected by effects.
Sculk catalysts bloom without spreading when an armor stand is destroyed.[3]
In Java Edition, summoning an armor stand with no health causes the death animation.[4]
Advancements count armor stands as mobs, and they can be used for advancements such as adventure and arbalistic.
Armor[edit | edit source]
Any armor on the stand drops when the stand is broken. Armor stands can display enchanted, trimmed, and all forms of dyed armor. The effects of most enchanted armor have no effect when on an armor stand, with a few exceptions:
Frost Walker creates frosted ice blocks on water as usual if an armor stand is pushed with a piston, although results are inconsistent.[5][6][7] It also prevents the armor stand from catching on fire as a result of coming into contact with a campfire.
Depth Strider slows the movement of the armor stand when being pushed with water.
In Java Edition, a player may take damage from hitting an armor stand that holds armor enchanted with Thorns.[8]
Soul Speed negates any speed reduction from an armor stand moving over soul sand.
Fire Protection generally reduces the burn time and damage taken when an armor stand comes into contact with blocks that catch it on fire, though the effects are inconsistent between different levels of Fire Protection and different sources of fire damage. Furthermore, if a collective of 7 or more levels of Fire Protection is applied to the armor an armor stand wears, it will not catch fire or take damage from any fire source.
In Java Edition, armor stands wearing leather boots will stand on top of powder snow, where other stands without leather boots will fall through.
Status effects[edit | edit source]
In Bedrock Edition, armor stands can be affected by status effects.[9] They can be 'killed' by Harming and Decay splash/lingering potions, lava, fire, and campfires, and they play the player death sound and fall to their side and disappear, yielding no armor stand item. If an armor stand is equipped with an item or armor, that item or armor is considered as ""naturally-spawned equipment"" with an 8.5% chance of dropping when the armor stand ""dies"" from the Instant Damage or the Wither status effect. If the dropped item is any form of weapon, tool or armor, it drops in a badly damaged state because the game considers it as ""naturally-spawned equipment"".
In Java Edition, armor stands can be given status effects only via commands, as they ignore any effect source in regular gameplay (splash potions, area effect clouds, shulker bullets, etc).[10] Armor stands with status effects do not emit particles, and are immune to most effects except for Glowing, Levitation, and Slow Falling.
Mob interactions[edit | edit source]
Zoglins, goats in Java Edition, and vindicators named Johnny in Bedrock Edition[11] attack armor stands, but the armor stand remains undamaged; pufferfish also inflate when an armor stand is nearby.[12] Statistics classify the armor stand as mobs if the player dies while hitting the armor stand with the thorns enchantment.
Invisible and marker armor stands[edit | edit source]
This feature is exclusive to Java Edition. 
An invisible armor stand (left) and a marker armor stand with no base plate (right) in Spectator mode.
In Java Edition, armor stands can be made invisible or used as markers by setting the NBT tags {Invisible: 1b} or {Marker: 1b} respectively. Both invisible[13] and marker armor stands are invulnerable to all attacks, including explosions and players in Creative mode; they can be removed only using the /kill command. Mobs ignore invisible and marker armor stands.[14]
Invisible armor stands still render any equipped items, have a hitbox, and can be interacted with by players in any game mode. Similar to mobs affected by the Invisibility effect, invisible armor stands can only be seen by players in Spectator mode, players in the same team as the invisible armor stand, or if the stand has the Glowing effect.
Marker armor stands are unaffected by physics (gravity, knockback, flowing water, pistons, etc). They have a hitbox size of 0, meaning that players and dispensers cannot interact with them. Due to the lack of a hitbox, it is possible to place blocks in the space visually occupied by a marker armor stand, or target blocks and entities behind it.
Sounds[edit | edit source]
Java Edition:
Armor stands use the Friendly Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.

Issues[edit | edit source]
Issues relating to ""Armor Stand"" are maintained on the bug tracker. Issues should be reported and viewed there.
Trivia[edit | edit source]
Equipping armor stands with certain blocks and items can cause rendering glitches. According to Searge this is due to transparent rendering on entities not yet being supported.[26][27]
Placing the stand within three powered redstone dust always changes its pose to the honor pose. Repeaters also switch the stand to the honor pose if not set four blocks from one.
Secret signatures for JAPPA, Chi Wong, and Searge can be found at the bottom of the armor stand texture.

Picking up arrows[edit | edit source]
Arrows shot by players can always be picked up in Creative mode.
An arrow cannot be picked up by a player in Survival or Adventure mode if:
It is shot by a player in Creative mode.
It is shot by any mob able to shoot arrows, such as skeletons, strays, pillagers, or piglins. This includes mobs that do not shoot arrows in normal gameplay, such as illusioners and bow-wielding wither skeletons.
This is the case even in Creative mode.[1]
It is shot with an Infinity-enchanted bow.
It is one of the two extra arrows shot with a Multishot-enchanted crossbow.
Arrows that are stuck in a player cannot be retrieved, and the player does not drop them when killed.
Mob loot[edit | edit source]
Skeletons, strays and boggeds drop 0-2 arrows upon death. The maximum drop is increased by 1 per level of Looting, for a maximum of 0–5 arrows with Looting III.
In Bedrock Edition, pillagers also drop 0–2 arrows upon death. The maximum drop is increased by 1 per level of Looting, for a maximum of 0-5 arrows with Looting III.

Spawning[edit | edit source]
An arrow entity spawns when an arrow item is shot out of a bow, crossbow, dispenser, or a bow- or crossbow-wielding mob. Arrow entities spawn with a starting velocity calculated using the following process:
The direction of the velocity is set as the facing vector of the entity that shot it, or the vector pointing straight out of a dispenser.
The magnitude of the velocity is set as 0 to 3 for bows depending on how far they're drawn, 3.15 for crossbows, and 1.1 for dispensers.
A random vector is added to the previously determined velocity. This vector ranges from

on every axis. Inaccuracy is 1 for bows and crossbows, and 6 for dispensers.
Because crossbows shoot slightly faster arrows than bows but have the same inaccuracy, crossbows can feel more accurate; Their randomness is smaller in proportion to their total velocity.
Movement[edit | edit source]
An arrow entity follows this list of steps in order when calculating its movement each game tick:
If it is intersecting a block's collision box, its inGround NBT value is set to true.
If it is on fire and in rain, water, or powder snow (including cauldrons containing water or powder snow), its fire is extinguished.
If inGround is true: Expand
If inGround is false:
It calculates collisions with blocks and entities: Expand
Its velocity vector is added to its position vector.
Its velocity vector is multiplied by 0.99 if it's in air or 0.6 if it's in water (this is the ""drag"").
0.05 is subtracted from its velocity vector's y component (this is the ""gravity"").
The arrow movement (when not stuck in a block) can be solved as a recurrence relation to obtain the following formulas:

Where

is the position at tick t. These formulas can quickly calculate the position and velocity at a future tick t given an initial position and velocity. To make them work for arrows in water instead, change 0.99 with 0.6 and 100 with 2.5.
Damage[edit | edit source]
The damage an arrow inflicts on an entity depends on the damage NBT tag, the crit NBT tag, and the arrow's speed.
The damage NBT tag is determined by the item that shot it: It is 2 for everything except bows enchanted with Power, in which case it's

Common properties[edit | edit source]
Arrows shot from a bow with the Flame enchantment, or shot through lava or fire, catch on fire and show an appropriate animation until they pass through water or rain. They can set other entities they hit on fire for up to 5 seconds (inflicting up to 4HP of fire damage)[citation needed], as well as ignite TNT, candles, and campfires.
An arrow shot in a tree
Arrows also stick into blocks they come in contact with and remain there for one minute before disappearing. Such arrows may be retrieved. The 1-minute despawn timer is then refreshed, meaning it takes another minute for the arrow to despawn.
Arrows can get visually stuck in players in Java Edition, although not any mobs. They appear as regular arrows regardless of type.[2]
Steve covered in arrows
Alex covered in arrows
If the arrow has any custom potion effects (NBT tag CustomPotionEffects), all potion effects, including vanilla potion effects (NBT tag Potion) are removed 30 seconds after the arrow stops moving.
An arrow shot at a chorus flower or decorated pot breaks the block; a chorus flower drops itself, while a decorated pot shatters into pottery sherds and/or bricks along with dropping any of the items stored inside.
Redstone circuits[edit | edit source]
An arrow can activate a wooden button, wooden pressure plate, a tripwire, or a target. An arrow continues to power these blocks until it is removed, either due to despawning, or being picked up. Target blocks emit a redstone pulse for one second, as opposed to the static depressed state of the other switches. Non-wooden switches are not affected by arrows.
Sounds[edit | edit source]
Java Edition:
In Java Edition, arrows use the Friendly Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.

Issues[edit | edit source]
Issues relating to ""Arrow"" are maintained on the bug tracker. Issues should be reported and viewed there.
Trivia[edit | edit source]
By default, arrows fly slightly offset to the right. If the player stands close to a wall and fires several arrows without moving the crosshair, the arrows cluster around a point slightly to the right of the crosshair. If the player switches their main hand to be the left hand in options, the arrows instead cluster to the left.
Arrows fired at nether portals often skip through the portal block completely and fail to collide, thus continuing through to the opposite side of the block.
Arrows stuck in blocks vibrate upon a world reload.[4]

All axes except for netherite ones can be found in many structures in the game. Wooden and stone axes can also be found in bonus chests.
Villager gifts[edit | edit source]
This feature is exclusive to Java Edition. 
Toolsmith villagers occasionally throw stone axes at players with the Hero of the Village status effect.
Weaponsmith villagers occasionally throw either stone, gold, or iron axes at players with the Hero of the Village status effect.
Usage[edit | edit source]
Chopping[edit | edit source]
An axe is used to break logs, blocks derived from wood and some other blocks faster than by using other tools. An axe uses 1 durability to break 1 block. For blocks that break instantly, it uses 0 durability.
Durability[edit | edit source]
Each tier of axe has a different durability:
Material In Java Edition In Bedrock Edition
Wood 59 60
Stone 131 132
Iron 250 251
Diamond 1561 1562
Golden 32 33

↑ These durations ignore other influential factors (e.g. Mining Fatigue), and are measured in seconds. For more information, see Breaking § Speed.
Stripping[edit | edit source]
Using an axe on a log, wood block, block of bamboo, or block of copper causes it to become a stripped log, stripped wood block, block of stripped bamboo, or removes one layer of oxidization or wax, respectively. This consumes one point of durability from the axe.
Weapon[edit | edit source]
An axe loses 2 points of durability when used as a weapon. Attacking a shielding player with an axe disables the use of all of their shields for 5 seconds. Vindicators, piglin brutes, and other axe-wielding mobs can also disable a shielding player's shield.
Java Edition[edit | edit source]
In Java Edition, damage done when using an axe as a weapon is more than that of a sword of the same tier, though they take longer than a sword to recover, resulting in lower DPS (with the exception of golden axes). The damage dealt and cooldown time depends on the type:
Material Attack Damage Attack Speed Recovery time DPS Lifetime damage inflicted[note 1]
Wooden 7HP 0.8 1.25 seconds (25 game ticks) 5.6 210HP × 105
Gold 7HP 1.0 1 second (20 game ticks) 7.0 112HP × 56
Stone 9HP 0.8 1.25 seconds (25 game ticks) 7.2 594HP × 297
Iron 9HP 0.9 1.1 seconds (22 game ticks) 8.1 1125HP × 562.5
Diamond 9HP 1.0 1 second (20 game ticks) 9.0 7029HP × 3514.5
Netherite 10HP 1.0 1 second (20 game ticks) 10.0 10160HP × 5080
↑ The formula to find the total lifetime damage is ceil(durability ÷ 2) × damage per hit. The durability is halved then ceiled because axes take double durability when used as a weapon, and the last 1 durability can also deal damage. The formula also ignores enchantments and critical hits, and assumes each attack is performed at maximum charge.
Bedrock Edition[edit | edit source]
In Bedrock Edition, axes always attack instantly and deal 1HP less damage than a sword of the same quality.

An axe can be repaired in an anvil by adding units of the tiers' repair material, with each repair material restoring 25% the axe's maximum durability, rounded down. Two axes of the same tier can also be combined in an anvil. Both methods preserve the axe's enchantments, unlike by crafting to repair.

Issues[edit | edit source]
Issues relating to ""Axe"" are maintained on the bug tracker. Issues should be reported and viewed there.
Trivia[edit | edit source]
Before Java Edition 1.13, in the language files, axes were referred to as Hatchets.[4]
Weaponsmith villagers gifting stone, iron and golden axes is a reference to the story The Honest Woodcutter, where a woodcutter dropped his axe into a river, and is successively provided a silver and a golden axe by the river god.[citation needed]

Usage[edit | edit source]
When used on a mob, a fence, or a wall, balloons attach to the mob or block, similar to a lead. A balloon remains grounded if tied to a fence or a wall. When untied by right-clicking on it, a balloon rises into the air quickly.
When a balloon is shot by an arrow, wind charge, or a trident, or floats into a solid block, it pops, summons particles, and is destroyed. It drops nothing. A balloon tied to a fence post bursts when a player strikes it from any direction.
A balloon attached to a mob can lift up the mob, more slowly than the ballon rises on its own. If tied to a mob whose mass is less than or equal to 1, the balloon floats away and carries the mob high into the air, before both eventually disappear. Destroying or detaching the balloon from its suspended mob causes the mob to fall and take fall damage. When attached to a mob whose mass is above 1, the balloon floats up to the limit of its tether, briefly yanking the mob upward by a fraction of a block, but otherwise the mob remains on the ground.
A heavier mob with mass above 1 falls slowly while attached to a balloon. The balloon despawns when the mob falls more than 16 blocks. Currently, the only heavy mob that can have a balloon attached is the iron golem. A balloon cannot be attached to a ravager.
A player holding a balloon falls normally and takes normal fall damage.[more information needed]
Attachable mobs and entities[edit | edit source]
Generally, non-hostile terrestrial mobs can be attached to a balloon. A balloon can attach to almost any entity that a lead can attach to, except for axolotls and frogs. Balloons can also attach to pandas, which leads cannot. A mob can have both a lead and balloon attached at the same time if the lead is attached before the balloon.

Obtaining[edit | edit source]
Farming[edit | edit source]
Beetroots are obtained from harvesting a fully grown crop block, which drops 1 beetroot and 1-4 seeds (2 5⁄7 seeds per plant harvested on average). Seed yield can be increased using a tool enchanted with Fortune, with Fortune III harvesting an average of 5 3⁄7 seeds per plant.
These crops can be found growing in villages or can be grown from planted beetroot seeds.
Usage[edit | edit source]
Food[edit | edit source]
A beetroot can be eaten to restore 1 () hunger and 1.2 hunger saturation. Six beetroots can be crafted into beetroot soup, which restores six times the hunger and saturation of a single beetroot.

See also: Crop farming
Beetroot seeds can be planted on farmland to create a plant that grows through 4 stages of growth. The seeds require a light level of 8 or greater to plant‌[Java Edition only] and 9 or greater to grow. In Bedrock Edition they can be planted at any light level, but need a internal light level of 9 to grow. When fully grown, the plant can be broken to harvest beetroot seeds and beetroots.
While beetroot crops have only four growth stages compared to eight for wheat, carrots and potatoes, each growth tick has a 1⁄3 chance of not advancing the growth stage and therefore beetroot grows slightly faster than other crops.
Crops grow faster if the farmland they are planted in is hydrated. One application of bone meal has a 75% chance of advancing growth by one stage. This is less effective than for other crops: an average of 5 1⁄3 are needed to fully grow beetroot compared to 2 2⁄7 for other crops.
Crops break if pushed by a piston or if their supporting farmland breaks or turns to dirt (e.g. by being trampled), dropping their usual drops.
Breeding[edit | edit source]
Like other seeds, beetroot seeds can be used to breed chickens, lead chickens around, and make baby chickens grow up faster by 10% of the remaining time.
Taming[edit | edit source]
Like other seeds, beetroot seeds can be used to tame parrots.
Composting[edit | edit source]
Placing beetroot seeds into a composter has a 30% chance of raising the compost level by 1.

A player enters a boat by using it, if the boat is not fully occupied (boats can hold two entities). Unlike beds, there is no message above the hotbar for attempting to enter a fully occupied boat.[2]
Exiting[edit | edit source]
A boat can be exited by sneaking or, in Bedrock Edition, pressing down the right analog stick on a controller, tapping the ""Leave Boat"" button when using touch controls, or jumping. When exiting a boat, the player is placed in the direction the player is facing, or, if facing directly up or down, the player is placed in front of the boat. The exiting player is placed on land if possible from the dismounting position.
Motion[edit | edit source]
Boats do not turn with mouse-look.
With a keyboard or gamepad, boats are controlled using the forward, left (turns left), right (turns right), and backward keys. Using the sprint key increases the field of vision, but does not increase speed as if sprinting.
With touchscreen controls, two buttons for steering appear. The right button or key steers to the left, and the left button or key steers to the right. Pressing both buttons or keys moves the boat forward.
In Java Edition, boats can be ridden against a current, but cannot be ridden upstream to a higher elevation. A boat lift, usually made from tripwire, pistons, and optionally a slime block, can be used to move a boat up. Bubble columns created with soul sand can also be used to push boats upward. These mechanisms can also be used in Bedrock Edition but are usually unnecessary because boats can be ridden upward in descending water, as well as follow upward stair-step currents.
Behavior[edit | edit source]
Speed[edit | edit source]
Boats move according to the player's control or water currents, with speed affected by the surface traversed. Boats move extremely quickly on ice,[3] allowing for the construction of fast transportation systems in any dimension.
Drag is applied proportionally against the boat’s current velocity, causing its speed to decay exponentially.
When the forward or backward command is issued, a constant thrust is applied relative to the boat's facing direction, exponentially approaching the top speed at which thrust balances drag.The backward thrust is one-eighth that of the forward thrust’s strength.
When strafe commands are issued, a constant torque is applied to increase the boat's rotation speed, with the same drag mechanism limiting the maximum rate of rotation.
Substance Top Speed Max Yaw Rate
Water 8.0 blocks/s 200 deg/s
Ice, frosted ice, packed ice 40 blocks/s 1000 deg/s
Blue ice 72.72... blocks/s 1818.18... deg/s
Land 2.0 blocks/s 50 deg/s
Slime block 1.181 blocks/s 100 deg/s
Honey block, soul sand 1.053 blocks/s
The torque and thrust values differ between Java and Bedrock edition, as are the linear drag coefficients of various surfaces which are proportionally scaled to produce the same top speed/max yaw rate between two editions
Front Thrust Back Thrust Torque Blue Ice Pack/Frost/Ice Water Slime Land
Java Edition 16 blocks/s2 2 blocks/s2 400 deg/s2 0.22 s-1 0.4 s-1 2 s-1 4 s-1 8 s-1
Bedrock Edition ??? ??? ??? ??? ??? ??? ??? ???
Flotation[edit | edit source]
The animation of an oak boat when atop a bubble column.
A boat floats atop still or flowing water. In Java Edition, a boat sinks if it enters a waterfall.[4] In Bedrock Edition, a boat does not sink when submerged but floats up. This feature lets a player contrive stepped uphill water flows to propel a boat uphill using only flowing water.
When a boat moves over a bubble column, it begins to shake. If the bubbles are caused by a magma block, all passengers are expelled and the boat sinks.
In Java Edition, a sunken boat cannot be re-floated until a bubble column pushes it up or it is broken by the player. In Bedrock Edition, a boat resumes floating when it emerges from the currents keeping it down, or when the bubble column is blocked or removed.
Dolphins chase players riding a boat in motion, occasionally bumping the boat, causing it to shake briefly.
Destruction[edit | edit source]
As boats are entities, they have health. Boats effectively have just over 4HP‌[Java Edition only] (exactly 4 damage is not enough to destroy a boat), and regenerate 1⁄10 per game tick. Due to bug MCPE-62683 boats in Bedrock Edition have 40HP × 20 health.
Boats can be destroyed by explosions, fire and lava (but not magma blocks), cactus, and by being punched/shot by mobs, such as drowned. Boats made invulnerable with commands cannot be broken by any of these, but they still cannot be used to travel on lava because they sink.
When a boat is destroyed, it drops itself in item form.
Passengers[edit | edit source]
Multiple mobs in 2 types of boats.
Boats can support two riders, including mobs. A mob cannot exit a boat and is trapped until the boat gets destroyed, or until the player uses a fishing rod or lead to remove the mob. This can be used to transport mobs, although hostile mobs still attack while in boats. Mobs riding a boat don't despawn‌[Java Edition only] and don't count toward the mob cap.[5]
A player cannot both move (row) and use items at the same time. It is still possible to initialize item use (e.g. start eating) and row the boat while the item is still in the middle of the use animation. Although the rowing animation overrides the item use animation, the item can still be successfully consumed.
Being in a boat limits the player's mouse-look to the forward 210° arc in Java Edition and 180° in Bedrock Edition.
Underwater boats cannot be ridden. When the boat is underwater, all passengers in it are expelled.
Damage prevention[edit | edit source]
Riding a boat does not deplete hunger, making it an efficient way to travel.
Boats can completely nullify fall damage for themselves and any players/mobs inside, making them useful for travel through mountains or through the Nether. In previous Java Edition versions, a bug caused the player to take full damage at specific heights; for example, 49 or 51 blocks[6][7]. However, this has been patched out in 1.21.2.[8]
Collision[edit | edit source]
A boat has a solid collision box, which means players and other entities can't go through it even with high speed. Falling blocks are also blocked by boats.
In Java Edition, a boat falling on top of an entity stops on top of the entity. In Bedrock Edition, a falling boat can go through other entities.
Riding a boat over a lily pad causes the lily pad to drop, although the boat's speed stutters a bit.
Mobs[edit | edit source]
Most mobs can ride boats. Mobs cannot exit the boat unless the boat is destroyed, sinks, or moves over a bubble column.
Mobs can be picked up into the boat when they collide with the side of the boat. A mob cannot control the boat. In Java Edition, a boat being ridden by a player cannot pick up a mob. In Bedrock Edition, mobs can be picked up by a boat being ridden by a player. In Minecraft Education, even tripod cameras can ride boats.
A mob can ride a boat if it is narrower than a boat, and is neither an aquatic[9] nor ambient animal. The following mobs are unable to ride in a boat:
Agent
Bat
Cod
Creaking
Dolphin
Elder guardian
Ender dragon
Ghast
Giant
Glow squid
Iron golem
NPC
Pufferfish
Ravager
Salmon
Spider
Squid
Tadpole
Tropical fish
Warden[10]
Wither[10]
The baby counterparts of these mobs are able to ride in boats, but not the adult versions:
Camel
Donkey
Hoglin
Horse
Mule
Polar bear
Skeleton horse
Sniffer
Zoglin
Zombie horse
Additionally, few types of mobs can have various Size values, which can prevent them from riding boats:
Slime above size 1
Magma cube above size 1
Phantom above size 3
Lead[edit | edit source]
Leads can be attached to boats and can break when stretched too far due to boats moving much slower on land.
The lead has no effect if a player is riding the boat. However, if any mob is riding the boat, the boat can be tugged along. This includes villagers, making transportation easier in early game with just a few boats and leads.
Sounds[edit | edit source]
Java Edition:
Boats use the Friendly Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.

12w23a Boats can now accelerate to faster than previous speeds, and are now easier to control.
12w27a Boats now drop their item instead of 3 oak planks and 2 sticks if broken by a player.
Instead, it needs to fall certain heights to drop 3 oak wood planks and 2 sticks.
1.3 The texture of the oak boat item has been changed.
1.6.1 13w16a Boats are now dismounted using the sneak key; previously, this was achieved by right clicking on the boat a second time.

Boats being broken by lily pads has been slightly improved.
Left, back and right controls added again.
1.8 14w06a Mobs riding boats can now control them, so that they can chase or flee enemies, move toward food, move about randomly, or whatever they would do on land. The exceptions are the ghast and bat, both of which cannot control boats.
1.8.2 pre2 Boats can now survive crashes at higher speeds.
1.9 15w41a
Boats have been overhauled to match the boats from Pocket Edition Alpha 0.11.0. They now have oars for paddling and are more durable and now allows passengers to board.
Mobs can now board boats, though they can no longer control them.
A new set of controls have been introduced: it includes holding down the right and left keys to move forward, and using the right key to move the right oar, turning the boat to the left (and vice-versa). Mouse movement no longer turns boats, and the forward and back keys no longer have any effect.
Players can no longer use items or attack from boats unless they were at a complete stop.
The crafting recipe for boats has been changed to require a wooden shovel as shown below.

Issues[edit | edit source]
Issues relating to ""Boat"" are maintained on the bug tracker. Issues should be reported and viewed there.
Trivia[edit | edit source]
Sand, red sand, concrete powder, gravel, anvils, and dragon eggs drop as items when they fall onto a boat that is in water.
A chest is short enough that a boat falls onto it rather than crashes into it.
In Legacy Console Edition, holding the movement stick to the side in a boat on blue ice causes the player to spin quickly. If a passenger is in the boat while this occurs, when the player exits the boat after it reaches maximum velocity (attained after about three seconds), for most mobs, the mob's head may spin uncontrollably. For some mobs, however, nothing happens (such as slimes and ghasts). The mob may also get its head stuck at an angle. Thorough testing was done on Minecraft: Wii U Edition, although the glitch was originally discovered on the Xbox 360 Edition.

Usage[edit | edit source]
A boat with chest can be used for the transportation of players, mobs and items, or as fuel when smelting.
Fuel[edit | edit source]
A boat with chest can be used as fuel in a furnace, lasting 60 seconds and smelting up to 6 items.
Transportation[edit | edit source]
Main article: Boat § Transportation
Boats with chests can carry only one entity while regular boats can carry up to two. The chest occupies the passenger seat.
Behavior[edit | edit source]
All types of boats with chests.
Main article: Boat § Behavior
Boats with chests share most behaviors with boats.
Item storage[edit | edit source]
The GUI of a boat with chest.
The inventory of the boat with chest has the same amount of slots as a single chest. Its inventory can be accessed by sneaking and interacting with the boat with chest, interacting with the part of the boat with chest that actually contains the chest while another player or entity is inside the boat, or by opening the player's inventory while inside the boat. This means that the player cannot access armor slots without exiting the boat.
When a boat with chest moves above, underneath, or beside a hopper, its inventory is filled or drained accordingly. Due to the size of its hitbox, a boat with chest can be placed above up to 9 hoppers, allowing it to evenly split its items nine ways.
Piglin[edit | edit source]
As with other chests, opening or breaking a boat with chest causes nearby piglin(s) to attack the player.
Sounds[edit | edit source]
Java Edition:
Boats with chests use the Friendly Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.

Trivia[edit | edit source]
A chest is short enough that a boat with chest falls onto it rather than crashes into it.
The chest texture is 12×12 pixels, rather than the 14×14 pixel texture the block uses. This is not the case with the minecart with chest.
Despite the minecart with chest using the Christmas texture, the boat with chest still uses the default chest texture during Christmas time.[1]

Dye[edit | edit source]
In Bedrock Edition and Minecraft Education, bone meal can be:
Applied to sheep to dye their wool, which can then be sheared for 1–3 blocks of white wool.
Applied to tamed wolves to dye their collars.
Applied to tamed cats to dye their collars.
Used to dye or stain leather armor, beds, glass, terracotta and shulker boxes.
Combined with gunpowder to make a firework star.
Combined with a firework star to create a fade-to-color effect.
Used to add patterns to banners.
Used to dye shulkers in Bedrock Edition and Minecraft Education.
Used to dye water contained in cauldrons in Bedrock Edition and Minecraft Education.
Combined with sand and gravel to craft concrete powder.
Combined with compounds to craft balloons or glow sticks in Bedrock Edition and Minecraft Education.
Used to change the color of text on signs or hanging signs.
Fertilizer[edit | edit source]
Bone meal can also be used on the following plants to have a chance to increase their growth stage:
Plant Action
Wheat
Carrots
Potatoes The plant matures 2–5 growth stages.
Beetroots The plant has a 75% chance of growing to the next growth stage.
Bamboo Grows the bamboo by 1-2 stems.
Melon Stem
Pumpkin Stem The planted stem matures 2–5 growth stages. Bone meal affects only the stem's growth; it does not cause melons or pumpkins to sprout from a mature stem.
Saplings
Azalea
Flowering Azalea
Mangrove Propagule (not hanging) The sapling has a 45% chance of growing to the next growth stage, if possible. Saplings have two growth stages (with no visible difference between them) before growing into trees as the third stage. A tree cannot grow unless the sapling is planted in proper ground and sufficient space is available. Using bone meal on such an obstructed sapling with no chance of growing wastes the bone meal.
Sunflower
Lilac
Rose Bush
Peony The corresponding item form drops, without destroying the original plant.
Short Grass
Fern
Seagrass A one-block-high tall short grass, fern, or seagrass (that is on grass block, dirt, coarse dirt, rooted dirt, farmland, podzol, mycelium, moss block, mud, or muddy mangrove roots) grows into a two-block-high tall grass, large fern, or tall seagrass.
Mushrooms Has a 40% chance of growing into a huge mushroom if on grass block, dirt, coarse dirt, rooted dirt, farmland, podzol, mycelium, moss block, mud, or muddy mangrove roots.
Cocoa The cocoa plant matures 1 growth stage.
Sweet Berry Bush The bush matures 1 growth stage.
Sea Pickle If the sea pickle is on a coral block and in water at least 2 blocks deep, the sea pickle colony grows, and additional sea pickles generate nearby.
Sugar Cane‌[BE only] The sugar cane grows to maximum height (three blocks tall).
Kelp The kelp plant grows by 1 block per bone meal used, up to its maximum height.
Flower (excluding wither rose and torchflower)‌[BE only] One-block-high flowers make more flowers of the same type grow in the surrounding area.
Fungus Grows into huge fungi, but only if on the respective nylium.
Weeping Vines Grows the weeping vines a few blocks downward.
Twisting Vines Grows the twisting vines a few blocks upward.
Cave Vines Produces glow berries if the vine did not have any glow berries on it already.
Glow Lichen The glow lichen spreads to a random adjacent block.
Moss Block The moss block causes nearby stone, cave vines, and dirt to become moss blocks.
Pale Moss Block The pale moss block causes nearby stone, cave vines, and dirt to become pale moss blocks, and turns into a pale moss patch.
Big Dripleaf
Small Dripleaf A big dripleaf grows one block higher, and a small dripleaf becomes a big dripleaf.
Rooted Dirt Causes hanging roots to grow underneath the rooted dirt if there is space.
Mangrove Leaves Creates a hanging mangrove propagule under the mangrove leaves.
Mangrove Propagule (hanging) The mangrove propagule matures 1 growth age.
Pink Petals Produces another pink petal in the block. If there are already four pink petals in the block, it drops a pink petal as an item.
Torchflower Crop
Pitcher Crop Grows every stage.
Tall Dry Grass Places a short dry grass on a neighboring block if possible.
Short Dry Grass Grows into tall dry grass.
Bone meal does not affect:
Cactus
Vines
Nether wart
Sugar cane‌[Java Edition only]
Chorus plants, or other plants not listed above.
Wasting bone meal[edit | edit source]
Bone meal can be used on the following objects in the following situations, consuming it without any real effect:
On short grass, ferns, and seagrass that do not have enough space to grow.[1]
On seagrass that doesn't have water above.
On a dark oak sapling that is not in a group of four.[2]
On a mushroom that is not on a block that allows it to grow into a huge mushroom.[3]
On a sea pickle that is already in a group of four and has no valid locations to expand to.[4]
On a sea pickle that is not on a coral block.
On a bamboo (not bamboo shoot) that is blocked in the way.
On a fungus that is not on its respective nylium.
Any plants whose growth is blocked by the build limit.
Creating new plants[edit | edit source]
Using bone meal on a grass block causes foliage to sprout on and around the targeted block. Grass blocks within a 15×5×15‌[JE only] or 7×5×7‌[BE only] area of the target block randomly chooses which type of foliage to grow, if any (provided there is adequate space for the plant to grow). The types of foliage that can be created in this way are short grass, fern‌[BE only], tall grass‌[JE only], flowers, and pink petals, with the latter two being dependent on external factors like the biome and coordinates. See Flower § Flower biomes and Flower § Post-generation for more information.
Using bone meal on a 2-block flower (rose bushes, sunflowers, lilacs or peonies) cause one of the same type of flower to drop, without breaking the original. This is the only way to reproduce these flowers, since they cannot generate from using bone meal on grass blocks.
Using bone meal on a non-transparent block that is underwater generates seagrass on that block and surrounding blocks. In Java Edition, coral and coral fans may have a chance to generate in warm ocean biomes; in Bedrock Edition, coral and coral fans can be generated in any biome. In Bedrock Edition, in order to successfully use bone meal underwater, there must be 2 water blocks above the block the bone meal is being used on, and the lower one must be non-flowing water.
Using bone meal on a sea pickle on a coral block creates sea pickles. This generates sea pickles up to 3 blocks (of coral) away, so a 7 × 7 square (49 blocks) of coral may be necessary, to return the most sea pickles per given bone meal attempt (more attempts grows them more numerously, exactly - including the range of it growing, like grass with heights on grass blocks - as coral and coral fans, though those others being non-solid blocks).
Using bone meal on netherrack adjacent to nylium converts the netherrack into nylium of the same type. If both crimson and warped nylium are adjacent to the netherrack that was applied with bone meal, there is a 50% chance that either type of nylium is created.
Using bone meal on nylium causes the corresponding nether roots and both types of fungi to appear on the nylium block and other nylium, netherrack, dirt or grass blocks nearby (in a 5 × 5 total area), with the type of fungi matching the type of nylium being more common. In addition, using bone meal on warped nylium creates nether sprouts and twisting vines.
Farmer villagers[edit | edit source]
Villagers with the farmer profession can collect bone meal from a full composter, with which they can make their crops grow faster.

Trivia[edit | edit source]
Bone meal can be used on the sides or bottom of a grass block, as well as on a grass block with plants already on top of it.
Regardless of if it succeeds in fertilizing, bone meal makes green sparkles. However, like smoke from a torch, the sparkles appear only if the player has particles set All or Decreased.
In real life, bone meal is used as a fertilizer to provide nitrogen and phosphorus to plants.

Books are items that play an important role for enchanting, used to craft the enchanting table itself as well as bookshelves required to power it up. Alternatively, books themselves can be enchanted in order to store and apply enchantments. A book can also be crafted into a book and quill, which allows players to write and keep text.

a b c d The enchantment is chosen randomly with equal chance of any enchantment type occurring (except for Soul Speed, Swift Sneak, and Wind Burst) and equal chance to get any level of the enchantment, meaning high-level enchantments are as likely as low-level enchantments. It is possible for a librarian to sell the same book more than once. The price in emeralds depends on the enchantment level and ""treasure"" status. The minimum price of a book is given by 2 + 3 * (enchantment level), while the maximum price is 6 + 13 * (enchantment level). The possible values are 5–19 emeralds for Lvl I, 8–32 for Lvl II, 11–45 for Lvl III, 14–58 for Lvl IV, and 17–71 for Lvl V. For treasure enchantments the price is doubled. The cost is capped at 64 emeralds. All values below this cap are equally probable.

Written Book


The input written book is not consumed.
The new copies are ""Copy of Original"" or ""Copy of Copy"", depending on whether the input written book is ""Original"" or ""Copy of Original"".
Copies of copies cannot be copied.
Copied books of the same generation (""Original"", ""Copy of Original"", ""Copy of Copy"", or ""Tattered"") stack.
Writing[edit | edit source]
By pressing use item or long pressing screen anywhere‌[Bedrock Edition only] while holding a book and quill in their hand, the player can open a text editor GUI.
In Java Edition, the player can write a single book up to 100 pages, with up to 1023 characters per page, and up to 102,300 characters inside the entire book.
In Bedrock Edition, the player can write a single book up to 50 pages long, with up to 256 characters per page, and up to 12,800 characters inside the entire book.
No page may be longer than 14 lines and each line can have a width of 122 pixels.
The player has the ability to copy and paste into books. However, the paste does not work if the text being pasted is longer than a single page. Most Unicode characters are available in books, and they may be pasted in without issue.
In singleplayer, the world pauses while a book is being edited.‌[Java Edition only]
The book writing interface must be closed by pressing the Done button. Any other way of closing it (such as by pressing the Escape key) causes all work from the session to be lost.
Lecterns[edit | edit source]
A book and quill (as well as a written book) can be placed on an empty lectern.
The lectern then emits a redstone signal depending on the displayed page in the book. On the last page, the lectern emits a signal strength of 15. This is why lecterns are listed in the ""redstone"" tab in the creative inventory.
Formatting codes[edit | edit source]
Main article: Formatting codes
Text in a book can be styled using codes starting with the § character (section sign).
§k creates randomly changing characters.
§l creates bold text.
§m creates strikethrough text.‌[JE only]
§n creates underlined text.‌[JE only]
§o creates italic text.
§0 – f (hexadecimal) creates colored text.
§r resets any of the previous styles so text after it appears normally.
If the player uses multiple codes, and continue typing past the end of a line, the next line exhibits only the last formatting code used.
Signing[edit | edit source]
Books can be signed by pressing the ""Sign"" button while in the interface. In Java Edition, when signed, a book bears the name of the player who wrote it and a title chosen upon signing. In Bedrock Edition, the book doesn't display the name of the player as the author; instead, the author can be any text the player wants. After it has been signed, it cannot be edited again – it has turned into a written book.
Special characters can be used in the title, if typed from a keyboard that supports them. Alt codes do not work, and the § character cannot be typed even using a keyboard that implements it, meaning titles cannot be colored or formatted in-game. However, on Linux using the compose key to produce special characters does work.
The title of the book can be up to 15 characters long[1], and the player cannot paste into a title. If a custom name is removed from a written book, it reverts back to the title it was given during the signing process.
Chiseled bookshelf[edit | edit source]
Using the chiseled bookshelf while having a book and quill in the main hand puts the book inside the chiseled bookshelf.

↑ In Java Edition only one is requested per trade because of MC-248042 — Librarian's book and quill trade is always discounted to 1 since books are unstackable. In Bedrock Edition, the second book is placed in another slot instead.
Inserting screenshots[edit | edit source]
This feature is exclusive to Minecraft Education. 
Screenshots in the portfolio can be inserted into book and quill.[2] This can be done by clicking the pencil button on the bottom of the page, and clicking the photo button (shown as an icon that looks like photo with a plus next to it).
The photo button brings up the portfolio menu, where players can select which screenshot to be inserted into the book and quill page. Each screenshot takes up one page.
Players can export their books and quills photos and written texts as a PDF file. The default name for the file is formatted ""(Book Name) (Author Name)"".

Trivia[edit | edit source]
The in-game restrictions on books are not hard limits. Third party editors or commands can make books have more than 100 pages‌[Java Edition only] (2,147,483,639 pages), more than 256 characters per page (32,767 characters per page), can change author names, and can have colored titles, among other things. These books still function properly in vanilla Minecraft, meaning the player may encounter such books on adventure maps or multiplayer servers.[5]
If the player renames a book and quill in an anvil before signing it, it retains the name from the anvil instead of taking the name from signing.

↑ When creating an enchantment offer, the game uses a random enchantment level from 5 – 19. The enchantments are never treasure enchantments.
Usage[edit | edit source]
Boots can be placed in the fourth armor slot of a player's inventory for activation.
Defense points[edit | edit source]
Defense points are each signified by half of a chestplate in the armor bar above the health bar. Each defense point reduces any damage dealt to the player that is absorbed by armor by 4%, increasing additively with the number of defense points. Different materials and combinations of armor provide different levels of defense.
The following table shows the amount of defense points added by boots.
Material Defense points
Leather 1 ()
Golden
Chainmail
Iron 2 ()
Diamond 3 ()
Netherite
Knockback resistance[edit | edit source]
Netherite boots provide 10% knockback resistance.
Durability[edit | edit source]
The following table shows the amount of damage each piece of armor can absorb before being destroyed.
Any ""hit"" from a damage source that can be blocked by armor removes one point of durability from each piece of armor worn for every 4HP of incoming damage (rounded down, but never below 1). Damage taken that armor doesn't protect (such as falling or drowning) does not damage the armor, even if it is enchanted to protect against that type of damage. The following chart displays how many hits boots can endure.
Netherite armor is not damaged by lava or fire when worn.

Armor trimming[edit | edit source]
It is possible to upgrade armor with trims. This requires a smithing template, a pair of boots, and an ingot or crystal (iron ingot, copper ingot, gold ingot, netherite ingot, emerald, redstone dust, lapis lazuli, amethyst shard, nether quartz, diamond, or resin brick).
These trims have no effect on the gameplay or strength of the armor.

Bottles of entity are joke drinks, introduced in 23w13a_or_b, that transform players into the respective mobs when drunk.
Splash bottles of entity are variations of bottles of entity that can be thrown.
A bottle of void is a special bottle that transforms a player back into their original form. Using one on a transformed player (or drinking it) removes the transformation and convert the bottle into a bottle of entity of that transformation, or a bottle of the players active effects if they were not transformed.
A transformation into an entity sometimes leads to special effects. For example, transforming into a chicken allows the player to glide slowly to the ground. The chicken, however, takes fall damage upon landing, killing it and transforming the player back to themselves.
Transforming into an enderman causes the player to be teleported randomly when a projectile is aimed at it or when they're being looked at by other players. Transforming into any mob capable of flight (for example, a bat) allows the player to fly in survival mode as if they were in creative mode. The Bottle of Entity is heavily based off of the famous Morph Mod.

Obtaining[edit | edit source]
Bottle of void is obtained by drinking a glass bottle. Rule ""drink_air"" must be approved to enable that. Then, by using the bottle of void on a mob, a bottle of that mob is obtained. This can be turned into a splash bottle of that mob in a brewing stand with gunpowder, just like any other potion.
Sounds[edit | edit source]
Splash bottles of entities use the Friendly Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.

Mob loot[edit | edit source]
Skeletons, strays, bogged and illusioners[edit | edit source]
Skeletons, strays, bogged and illusioners‌[JE only] have an 8.5% chance of dropping a normal or enchanted bow on death when killed by a player or a tamed wolf.
The chance of dropping a bow is increased by 1% per level of Looting, allowing up to an 11.5% chance of dropping.
The chance of being enchanted depends on the difficulty level, but the random enchantment level (5–22) does not.
Bows of skeleton traps are always enchanted at a random level from 5 to 23. The exact level depends on regional difficulty, as on Easy it is always a level-5 enchantment.

↑ When creating an enchantment offer, the game uses a random enchantment level from 5 – 19. The enchantments are never treasure enchantments.
Fishing[edit | edit source]
Main article: Fishing
Enchanted bows are obtainable through fishing, with a 0.8% chance per attempt. See fishing for more details. When caught, the bow may be damaged and contain random enchantments equivalent to a level 30 enchantment from an enchanting table, including treasure enchantments like Mending.
Usage[edit | edit source]
Weapon[edit | edit source]
Bows can be drawn back by using them. In order to use a bow, the player must have at least one arrow in their inventory or be in Creative mode. The arrow that is shown inside the bow always looks like a regular arrow, regardless of what kind of arrow is actually being shot from the bow.[1]
When drawing a bow, the display zooms in slightly. Charging the bow to its maximum causes it to visually shake as an indicator. Releasing the button shoots an arrow. Drawing a bow can be canceled by switching to another hotbar slot while holding use. Holding the bow at maximum charge for more than 72000 ticks (1 hour) results in the charge being reset without shooting an arrow.
While the bow is being charged or remains fully charged, the player is forced to move at sneaking speed, unless they are riding a horse, minecart or boat, or flying with elytra. It is not possible to sprint while charging a bow or holding a drawn bow. When the bow is released, normal motion resumes although any prior sprint is cancelled. Sneaking while drawing the bow makes the player move even slower.
If an arrow hits another player, the player that shoots the arrow hears a high-pitched ""ding"" sound.‌[Java Edition only]
Fully charged shots launch critical arrows that have a trail of particles behind them and deal up to
(
3
x
2
)
+
2
damage, where
x
is the damage after any enchantments. The listed values below describe maximum damage from a bow with no Power enchantments, assuming the target is at a distance where drag and gravity are negligible. The average damage of a shot at critical charge is around 9, as damage is dealt at a random value between
x
and
(
3
x
2
)
+
2
and it is rare to have minimum or maximum values. The damage dealt can ultimately be less than the maximum damage if the arrow slows down after being shot.
Charging time Attack damage
0.1 s (no charge) 1HP
0.2–0.9 s (medium charge) 5HP
1 s (full charge) 6HP
Above 1 s (critical charge) 6HP to 11HP × 5.5
The game stores the damage of arrows even in values with a decimal point. For example, it is possible for a critical arrow shot to cause damage values such as 6.4. In this case, the game can round up or down and store the amount for subsequent damage sources.
Any projectile thrown by the player is under the influence of momentum in current versions of Minecraft. Naturally, the player's movement speed can be modified under a number of circumstances, affecting the ballistic trajectory of projectiles, and as a result, the damage inflicted by arrows.
In Java Edition Combat Tests, to avoid sniping, arrows shot from fully-charged bows become non-critical if held drawn back for longer than three seconds. Instantaneous effects on tipped arrows are scaled by 1/8, just like the duration of other effects. For example, Instant Damage I arrow deals an additional 0.75HP × 0.375 magical damage.
Damage caused by the arrow is not affected by the Strength effect.
Few mobs cannot be shot using an arrow, because the arrow either disappears or it gets deflected. This includes:
Endermen - even while immobile, the enderman is immune to damage from arrows;
Breeze;
Wither under half health, when it gains wither armor;
Closed shulkers;
Ender dragon, while sitting on top of the exit portal.
Also, a shield can block any attack from the bow.

Fuel[edit | edit source]
A bow can be used as fuel in furnaces, smelting 1.5 items per bow in Java Edition or 1 item per bow in Bedrock Edition.
Arrows[edit | edit source]
Main article: Arrow
As in real life, a flying arrow in Minecraft is affected by gravity. Its vertical speed is modified by one block downward every second, resulting in a parabolic flight path. An arrow slows down if shot through water, reducing its damage to near zero unless brought back into the air or otherwise given momentum.‌[Java Edition only]
Arrows that hit solid blocks become stuck and can be retrieved, unless the arrow was shot by a bow enchanted with Infinity, a player in Creative mode, or a mob.
An arrow shot through lava ignites, giving it the effect of the Flame enchantment, igniting any entity it hits. If not extinguished, the fire inflicts up to 4HP damage. Although a wither skeleton does not spawn naturally with a bow, it shoots flaming arrows if given a bow using commands.
On impact, an arrow can trigger a wooden pressure plate, target block, wooden button, or tripwire. Arrows cannot trigger stone pressure plates or stone buttons.
The player can choose the type of arrow to shoot based on its location in the inventory. Arrows in the off-hand, or the selected hotbar slot if the bow is in the off-hand, are prioritized first. If there are no arrows in the off-hand or selected hotbar slot then the arrow closest to slot 0 is selected.

Java Edition Classic
June 14, 2009 Notch discussed how bows and arrows would work in Survival mode: ""Bows and arrows can be made out of wood. To use it, select the bow from your inventory and make sure you’ve got some arrows. Click in front of you, and an arrow goes flying using real physics. To actually HIT something, aim above it.""
0.24 SURVIVAL TEST The player did not need a bow to shoot arrows. Instead, Tab was used to fire arrows. However, arrows still had to be collected to shoot. Launching arrows this way was much slower than the bow that now fires them.

Java Edition Indev
0.31 20100110 Added bow texture to items.png.
20100122 Added bows as item with changed texture. The right mouse button can be held down to fire in rapid succession. Each arrow deals 4HP for each hit. They fly in a ballistic trajectory affected by gravity and drag in air or water. They travel approximately 15 blocks when fired parallel to a flat plane. Arrows also have a maximum range of around 52 blocks when fired at a 38 degree angle on a flat plane.
Bows often fail to interact with objects, but instead shoot. This is due to the fact that shooting arrows is an instantaneous action.
At this point, bows have no durability, and can essentially be used infinitely.

Mooshrooms[edit | edit source]
Using a bowl on a mooshroom turns the bowl into mushroom stew or suspicious stew. The stew can then be consumed immediately and the process repeated, making this an excellent way to quickly restore depleted hunger and saturation with almost no cost or effort.
Fuel[edit | edit source]
Bowls can be used as a fuel in furnaces, smelting 0.5 items per bowl in Java Edition, and 1 item per bowl in Bedrock Edition.

Trivia[edit | edit source]
in Bedrock Edition, bowls are actually more fuel efficient than sticks. If 6 wood planks are crafted into 8 bowls, 8 items can be smelted; but if those are crafted into 12 sticks, only 6 items can be smelted. This can be useful when the player only has access to Nether wood types, which cannot be used as fuel.

Combat[edit | edit source]
Players are able to throw brown eggs and deal knockback to mobs (but not other players‌[JE only][1]), but no damage is dealt, similar to a snowball. Likewise, throwing brown eggs at neutral mobs provokes them. Brown eggs can also be fired from dispensers and are affected by gravity. Brown eggs thrown through fire or lava in Bedrock Edition catch fire, and set fire to entities they hit.
Spawning chickens[edit | edit source]
When thrown by a dispenser or by pressing the use button, a brown egg has a 1⁄8 (12.5%) chance of spawning a warm chick. If this occurs, there is a 1⁄32 (3.125%) chance of spawning three additional warm chicks (on average, 1 out of every 256 brown eggs spawns 4 chicks). In other words, whenever a brown egg is thrown, there is a 31⁄256 chance of spawning 1 warm chick and a 1⁄256 chance of spawning four warm chicks.
The expected value of the number of warm chicks a brown egg produces is 35⁄256 or 13.7%. This means that on average, a warm chick is spawned every 7.3 brown eggs, a stack of 16 brown eggs spawns 2.188 warm chicks, and a full inventory including the hotbar and off-hand (37 × 16 = 592 brown eggs) is expected to spawn approximately 81 warm chicks.
For the purposes of establishing a new warm chicken farm with brown eggs alone, the probability P for at least 2 warm chicks to spawn after throwing n warm eggs can be calculated using the following formula:
P

When throwing 16 brown eggs, there is a 62% chance of spawning at least two warm chicks. When throwing 32 brown eggs, the probability rises to 92%
An average of 450 seconds elapses for a warm chicken to lay another brown egg. Accounting for all probabilities, the average warm chicken produces 1.09 warm chickens per hour when all the brown eggs it lays are thrown.

Brushing[edit | edit source]
Using the brush on any block (apart from suspicious blocks) displays a brushing animation, slowing down the player and creating breaking particles, but not actually damaging the block or brush.
Suspicious blocks[edit | edit source]
Main articles: Suspicious Sand and Suspicious Gravel
When continuously brushing suspicious sand or suspicious gravel, an item dependent on the structure's loot table slowly emerges from it until it drops out, and the block turns into regular sand or regular gravel, depleting 1 durability point on the brush. It takes 96 game ticks (4.8 seconds) to brush a single suspicious block.
If the player stops brushing a suspicious block, the block remains in its half-excavated state for a few seconds, before gradually returning to its unexcavated state one stage at a time.
Armadillos[edit | edit source]
When using the brush on an armadillo, it drops a single armadillo scute. Brushing an armadillo removes 16 points of durability from the brush. A brush with full durability and no enchantments can brush an armadillo four times in Java Edition or five times in Bedrock Edition before breaking.

Usage[edit | edit source]
Empty buckets can be used to ""pick up"" a water or lava source block by pressing use item on a block of the relevant type. If the empty bucket is part of a stack and the player's inventory is full, the filled bucket drops in front of the player as an item.
A bucket filled with a source block can then be used to place its source block contents in the empty block next to the side of the block the player is currently looking at, or replacing the block looked at for some replaceable blocks.
One can press use when looking at a cow, mooshroom, or goat to fill a bucket with milk. A bucket full of milk can be emptied only by drinking it or by using it to crafting a cake.
A bucket full of water can be used on a live aquatic mob (cod, salmon, tropical fish, pufferfish, axolotl, or tadpole) to collect the mob in the bucket for transportation to another location. The mob in item form becomes a bucket of aquatic mob.
An empty bucket can be used to empty a cauldron with water or lava, filling the bucket with the fluid. This does not work with dispensers[1].
A lava bucket placed in the fuel slot of a furnace becomes an empty bucket after the lava is consumed during smelting.
An empty bucket fills with water when placed in the fuel slot of a furnace while smelting a wet sponge.
An empty bucket can be used to collect powder snow, filling the bucket with powder snow. Emptying the powder snow bucket places the powder snow block in the empty block next to the side of the block the player is currently looking at.

Types[edit | edit source]
There are six types of bucket of aquatic mob:
Bucket of Axolotl
Bucket of Cod
Bucket of Pufferfish
Bucket of Salmon
Bucket of Tadpole
Bucket of Tropical Fish
Obtaining[edit | edit source]
A bucket of aquatic mob can be obtained by using a water bucket on an applicable mob. Once a water bucket is used, the mob is picked up along with the water source block. The mob bucket obtained corresponds to the mob picked up.
Usage[edit | edit source]
Pressing use with a bucket of aquatic mob places a water source block, and spawns the mob back into the world, leaving an empty bucket in the player's inventory. For buckets of tropical fish, the fish and its details (color, size, name) are kept. Placing a bucket of aquatic mob in the Nether causes the same particles to appear that generate when a normal water bucket is placed in the Nether, and the fish is spawned alone.
Mobs caught in buckets then released do not despawn, unlike mobs that spawn naturally in their aquatic environments.
If a bucket of aquatic mob is inside a dispenser, the dispenser spawns the mob and water block in front of it upon activation, leaving an empty bucket inside. Dispensers cannot pick up mobs with water buckets (the bucket is emptied).
Naming[edit | edit source]
If a bucket of aquatic mob is named a certain name through an anvil, the mob inside display that name as if it were named with a name tag, making fish, axolotls, and tadpoles the only mobs that can exist in item form, and be named without a name tag.‌[Java Edition only] Alternatively, if a named mob is captured with a bucket of water, the resulting mob bucket shares a name with the captured mob.‌[Java Edition only] If a named mob is captured in Bedrock Edition, the item is called ""Bucket of <Name>"".
Tropical fish have assigned names depending on their color after they are caught, in Java Edition this name is displayed in smaller text under the main item name, whereas in Bedrock Edition the main item name displays ""Bucket of <fish name>"". Axolotls also have assigned names depending on their growth stage and color after they are caught.‌[Bedrock Edition only]

Obtaining[edit | edit source]
A bucket of axolotl can be obtained by using a water bucket on an axolotl. Once a water bucket is used, the axolotl is picked up into the bucket.
Usage[edit | edit source]
Pressing use with a bucket of axolotl places a water source block, and spawns the axolotl back into the world, leaving an empty bucket in the player's inventory. Placing a bucket of axolotl in the Nether causes the same particles to appear that generate when a normal water bucket is placed in the Nether, and the axolotl is spawned alone.
Axolotls caught in buckets then released do not despawn, unlike mobs that spawn naturally in their aquatic environments.
If a bucket of axolotl is inside a dispenser, the dispenser spawns the axolotl and water block in front of it upon activation, leaving an empty bucket inside. Dispensers cannot pick up axolotls with water buckets (the bucket is emptied).
If a bucket of axolotl is named a certain name through an anvil, the axolotl inside displays that name as if it were named with a name tag.‌[Java Edition only] Alternatively, if a named axolotl is captured with a bucket of water, the resulting bucket of axolotl shares a name with the captured axolotl.‌[Java Edition only] If a named axolotl is captured in Bedrock Edition, the item is called ""Bucket of <Name>"".
Axolotl variants[edit | edit source]
In Bedrock Edition, if an axolotl is picked up with a bucket, the bucket appears in the player's inventory as ""Bucket of <Baby/Adult> <Color> Axolotl"" based on the age and color of the axolotl. These varieties are:
Bucket of Baby Leucistic Axolotl
Bucket of Adult Leucistic Axolotl
Bucket of Baby Brown Axolotl
Bucket of Adult Brown Axolotl
Bucket of Baby Gold Axolotl
Bucket of Adult Gold Axolotl
Bucket of Baby Cyan Axolotl
Bucket of Adult Cyan Axolotl
Bucket of Baby Blue Axolotl
Bucket of Adult Blue Axolotl
When the player spawns in an axolotl with a bucket of axolotl from the Creative inventory, it is always a leucistic adult. Buckets containing other variants always spawn that variant when used in creative mode.
The bucket of axolotl does not change textures in the inventory to reflect the captured axolotl's color, it always appears leucistic.

A bucket of salmon can be obtained by using a water bucket on a salmon. Once a water bucket is used, the salmon is picked up along with the water source block.
Usage[edit | edit source]
Pressing use with a bucket of salmon places a water source block, and spawns the salmon back into the world, leaving an empty bucket in the player's inventory. Placing a bucket of salmon in the Nether causes the same particles to appear that generate when a normal water bucket is placed in the Nether, and the salmon is spawned alone.
Salmon caught in buckets then released do not despawn, unlike mobs that spawn naturally in their aquatic environments.
If a bucket of salmon is inside a dispenser, the dispenser spawns the salmon and water block in front of it upon activation, leaving an empty bucket inside. Dispensers cannot pick up salmon with water buckets (the bucket is emptied).
If a bucket of salmon is named a certain name through an anvil, the salmon inside displays that name as if it were named with a name tag.‌[Java Edition only] Alternatively, if a named salmon is captured with a bucket of water, the resulting bucket of salmon shares a name with the captured salmon.‌[Java Edition only] If a named salmon is captured in Bedrock Edition, the item is called ""Bucket of <Name>"".

Obtaining[edit | edit source]
A bucket of tropical fish can be obtained by using a water bucket on a tropical fish. Once a water bucket is used, the tropical fish is picked up along with the water source block.
Trading[edit | edit source]
Wandering traders have 1⁄6 chance to sell a bucket of tropical fish for 5 emeralds. When placed, a bucket of tropical fish bought from a wandering trader has a random variant.
Usage[edit | edit source]
Pressing use with a bucket of tropical fish places a water source block, and spawns the tropical fish back into the world, leaving an empty bucket in the player's inventory. Placing a bucket of tropical fish in the Nether causes the same particles to appear that generate when a normal water bucket is placed in the Nether, and the tropical fish is spawned alone.
Tropical fish caught in buckets then released do not despawn, unlike mobs that spawn naturally in their aquatic environments.
If a bucket of tropical fish is inside a dispenser, the dispenser spawns the tropical fish and water block in front of it upon activation, leaving an empty bucket inside. Dispensers cannot pick up tropical fish with water buckets (the bucket is emptied).
If a bucket of tropical fish is named a certain name through an anvil, the tropical fish inside displays that name as if it were named with a name tag.‌[Java Edition only] Alternatively, if a named tropical fish is captured with a bucket of water, the resulting bucket of tropical fish shares a name with the captured tropical fish.‌[Java Edition only] If a named tropical fish is captured in Bedrock Edition, the item is called ""Bucket of <Name>"".
Breeding[edit | edit source]
Additionally, buckets of tropical fish may be used to breed and lead axolotls. It can also speed up the growth of a baby axolotl.
Tropical fish variants[edit | edit source]
Tropical fish also have assigned names that can be seen after capture. In Java Edition, the smaller text under the item name is displayed showing the fish name, similar to the text that displays enchantments under enchanted items. In Bedrock Edition, the item name is displayed showing ""Bucket of <fish name>"". Their colors are mostly named according to the colored block names, though with a few exceptions:
White
Silver
Gray
Black
Brown
Red
Orange
Yellow
Lime
Green
Teal
Sky
Blue
Plum
Magenta
Rose
The base color comes first, and if the pattern color is different, it comes after that. Lastly, the fish bucket is given a name according to the shape and pattern of the fish:
Flopper Glitter Betty
Stripey Blockfish Clayfish
Kob Snooper Brinely
SunStreak Dasher Spotty
Some tropical fish don't follow the normal naming system, and instead, reference real-life fish species. Apart from these names, these types of fish aren't different from regular tropical fish in terms of design or behavior.
These varieties are:
Name Type
Anemone Orange-Gray Stripey
Black Tang Gray Flopper
Blue Dory ‌[Bedrock Edition only] Gray-Sky SunStreak
Blue Tang ‌[Java Edition only] Gray-Blue Flopper

A bundle is an item that can store up to a stack's worth of mixed item types within itself in a single inventory slot. Items that stack to less than 64 occupy more space within the bundle, and items that do not stack occupy the entire bundle without allowing space for any other items.
Dyed bundles are the dyed variants of bundles.

64

Item stack sizes (top row) and the number of bundle slots they take up (middle row). Sticks stack to 64, so they take up one bundle slot; ender pearls stack to 16, so they take up four; and swords do not stack, so they take up the whole bundle. So, for instance, a bundle may have 32 sticks and 8 ender pearls inside, which take up a total of (32×1)+(8×4)=64 bundle slots.
Bundles are used to store different item types in the same inventory slot. This does not, however, increase the total capacity of the slot, as bundles can only store what adds up to a single slot. Items that can normally stack up to 64 take up 1/64 of a bundle, items that can normally stack up to 16 (eg. eggs) take up 1/16 of a bundle, and items that can't stack take up the entirety of a bundle (with exception to bundles themselves). On Java Edition, space that an item takes up in a bundle is equal to the reciprocal of its max_stack_size component, even if it is different from the standard 1, 16, and 64.
Bundles are not stackable, but they are able to be placed (nested) inside another[1], and will always take up 1/16 of the space of a bundle, regardless of their max_stack_size component, plus the space occupied by the inner bundle's contents.
Shulker boxes cannot be placed inside of bundles. However, bundles can be placed inside of shulker boxes.
Inserting and retrieving[edit | edit source]
Items are inserted into bundles by left-clicking, and retrieved by right-clicking.
To place items inside a bundle, either (1) pick up the bundle in the inventory and left-click on the item(s) to be placed inside or (2) pick up the item(s) and left-click on the bundle. When placing a bundle inside another bundle, the interface uses the first method: picking up bundle A and right clicking on bundle B attempts to store bundle B inside A.
Items can be retrieved from bundles in one of five ways:
Right-clicking on bundles in an inventory, without holding anything with the cursor, will cause the cursor to hold the item from the most recently added slot of the bundle.
Scrolling on bundles in an inventory allows for scrolling through the bundle's slots, which starts off as the most recently added slot, and is displayed with a bright underlay behind that slot. During this process, the bundle's icon will appear open, and the selected slot's item icon will appear within the bundle's icon, though this is not shown in the player's hand. If the bundle is right-clicked while in this state, the currently selected item will move to the cursor and the bundle will close. If the cursor is moved off the bundle while it's still open, the bundle will close.
Right-clicking on bundles in an inventory while they are held in the cursor and are hovering over an empty slot where can be placed will cause that item to be placed in that slot.
Using a bundle while it is selected in the hotbar will cause the contents of the most recently added slot to be thrown out in the direction the player is facing.
When a bundle item entity is destroyed, the contents of the bundle are dropped as items, similar to when a shulker box is destroyed.
GUI[edit | edit source]
Hovering over a quarter-full bundle with 16 items.
Hovering over a bundle reveals its blue fullness bar. When the bundle is empty, the fullness bar says ""Empty"" and shows the description, ""Can hold a mixed stack of items"". If it's completely full, the fullness bar turns red and says ""Full"". When there is at least one item in a bundle, space will open up above the bar, which displays the items in the bundle's slots, sorted by how recently they were added, from right to left. The space where the slots are shown is only wide enough for four slots, so additional space opens up for new rows. When there are more than three rows, only the top three will be displayed, and the bottom-right slot will be replaced by text that says, +<number of slots hidden>, where the slot replaced by the text counts toward that number.
Bundles show an additional fullness bar on their icons, in a similar way to how items that take damage show their durability. Bundle fullness bars are blue, or red when full, and appear when the bundle contains at least one item.

Trivia[edit | edit source]
Bundles are inspired by the ancient Roman coin purse, which have been used for thousands of years.[2]
The reason for why bundles can be dyed in 16 colors rather than a combination of multiple colors (like leather armor) is that Mojang considered it more important for players to be able to quickly identify the color of the bundle rather than being able to fully customize the color.[3]
Bundles are the first non-block item that uses the 16 color dyes versus the 2^24 leather dye system.[4]
Bundle is the last feature announced at Minecraft Live 2020 to be released. Minecraft Live 2020 took place on October 3, 2020 with the bundles announced for the Caves & Cliffs update while Bundles of Bravery was not released until 4 years and 19 days later on October 22, 2024.

Obtaining[edit | edit source]
The camera can be obtained in the Creative inventory in Minecraft Education. It can be obtained by either NBT editors, inventory editors, or glitches in Bedrock Edition.
Usage[edit | edit source]
Using a camera from one's inventory captures a first-person screenshot. It may also be placed, creating a camera entity that can track the user, and take pictures from the camera's perspective. Photos that are taken with the camera appear in the portfolio.
Close-up snapshots of an item on the ground can be taken by holding the Shift key while right-clicking.
Screenshots from camera can be inserted into book and quill.[1]
Photos that are taken with the camera block are stored in com.mojang/screenshots.
Behavior[edit | edit source]
Camera in a boat
Cameras are mostly inanimate entities, but they occasionally move when falling and they move at the player's direction when they take a picture.
Cameras are classified as mobs in the game code, they obey gravity, allowing them to fall and having effects common to all other entities. Cameras can be affected by status effects. They can be killed by Harming and Decay splash/lingering potions, and they play the player death sound and fall to their side and disappear, dropping no item. Cameras can't be leashed but they can ride on boats and minecarts.
Camera being harmed by poison effect
Cameras are harmed by fire, lava, and campfire damage but they never die from it. Cameras can be destroyed by any projectile used by the player, such as arrows, tridents, or snowballs. Cameras never drown and are invulnerable to the void, cacti, falling blocks, to explosions or by firework rockets.
Wardens, withers, zoglins, goats, and vindicators named Johnny attack cameras, but the camera remains undamaged; pufferfish also inflate when an camera is nearby. Foxes don't sleep near cameras as well.

Pocket Edition Alpha
v0.1.0 The textures and model of the camera can be found in the game apk file.[2][3]A Java method named saveScreenshot containing codes for saving image to device were found. A Java method named postScreenshotToFacebook was also found but it does not contain any code in it.
v0.2.0 Added cameras.
Changed item and tripod textures.
To use a camera, equip it in the player's hand, then look in the direction the player wants the picture to be taken. Long-press the screen, and a camera drops to the ground where the player are standing. Step back, then press on the camera until it starts emitting smoke particles. The smoke means a picture has been taken, and the camera may disappear immediately afterward.
Cameras have infinite uses.
The Entity ID is 62 and item 456.[4]
v0.4.0 The camera is now invisible and makes the standard player damage sound.
v0.7.0 Added the ""F1"" feature (Hide GUI), which has now made the camera obsolete.
v0.8.0 build 2 Item form now uses egg texture.
v0.9.0 build 1 The camera entity has been removed. Tommaso also stated: ""It doesn't mean that it's dead forever, in fact I have a lot of ideas for it! I think it will be back when have shaders, sharing and redstone.""[5]
v0.14.0 build 1 Re-added the camera, using a new model and item texture. It is accessible only with inventory editors.
If the player spawns a camera, leaves the world and joins back, it summons lightning.
v0.14.2 The camera item ID has been changed to 498, but it cannot be used at the moment. The entity can now be spawned with a spawn egg with a damage value of 62.
According to the language files of the game, the empty label that shows up whenever hovering a finger to a camera would now say ""Take Picture"". However, the button doesn't do anything.
v0.15.0 build 1 The previous empty label on the camera mentioned above now displays the words ""Take Picture"".
The health of the camera entity is now 2HP instead 4HP.
The camera no longer summons lightning.
v0.16.0 build 1 The camera now has a block form in inventory, but still spawns the entity. However, the block can be placed only with commands and editing.
""Take picture"" button on the camera works now, but no image files are created.
The original camera item ID (456) now refers to portfolio.
The changes to the camera were likely accidental due to Bedrock edition sharing the same codebase as Education Edition.
build 2 The camera now has an item form and the block has been removed. However, it is still obtainable in servers.
Portfolio, which works together with the camera to create collections of pictures, has been removed.
build 4 Camera item form has been removed, and the camera can no longer be obtained or placed using any command.

Future[edit | edit source]
At the Minecraft Pocket Edition panel at MINECON 2012, as well as one of Jbernhardsson's livestreams, it was stated that future plans include trying to have a proper use for cameras, perhaps an easier way to take screenshots and share them with others.[6] In the BlockTalk Q&A, the camera was briefly mentioned as part of a broader ""sharing"" theme planned for Bedrock Edition in the future.[7] It later got implemented into Minecraft Education, using the camera to make screenshots and share them in a special book.
Issues[edit | edit source]
Issues relating to ""Camera"" are maintained on the bug tracker. Issues should be reported and viewed there.
Trivia[edit | edit source]
A camera prevents a book and quill from working. Attempting to craft it or obtain it by commands gives a regular book instead, due to non-implementation of photo attaching to written books.[verify]
The camera can take a screenshot, which appears a bit smaller with a thick paper outline having cuts on its edges, making it look like an old photograph.
This feature is hidden from the Creative inventory and from the /give command item menu.

Obtaining[edit | edit source]
Breaking[edit | edit source]
See also: Fortune § Seeds
Fully grown carrot crops drop 2 to 5 carrots (3 5⁄7 per crop harvested on average). Yield can be increased using a tool enchanted with Fortune, with Fortune III harvesting an average of 5 3⁄7 carrots.
The yield is calculated by a binomial distribution: 2 drops are fixed, then a drop is attempted three times with a success rate of 57.14286% to yield the extra 0–3 drops. Each level of Fortune enchantment increases the number of attempts by one.

Axes are considered the preferred tool,[1] and swords would also increase the breaking speed,[2] however these ultimately have no impact due to the instant default mining speed.
Natural generation[edit | edit source]
Village farm plots have a chance of having carrots. The exact chance depends on the style of the village:
Village style Chance
Plains 30%
Snowy 10%
Mob loot[edit | edit source]
Zombies, husks, and zombie villagers have a 2.5% (1⁄40) chance of dropping either an iron ingot, carrot, or potato when killed by a player or tamed wolf. This is increased by 1% (1⁄100) per level of looting. This gives carrots the following chances of dropping:
1⁄120 (about 0.83%)
7⁄600 (about 1.17%) with Looting I

Usage[edit | edit source]
Food[edit | edit source]
See also: Hunger management
To eat a carrot, press and hold use while the carrot is selected in the hotbar. Eating a carrot restores 3 () hunger and 3.6 hunger saturation.
Farming[edit | edit source]
See also: Crop farming
Carrots can be farmed and harvested on farmland. Planted carrots go through 8 stages of growth, but only 4 apparent stages because the texture only changes upon reaching stages 1, 3, 5, and 8 with stage 8 being the final, mature appearance.
Carrots require a light level of 8 or greater to plant‌[Java Edition only] and 9 or greater to grow. In Bedrock Edition they can be planted at any light level, but need an internal light level of 9 to grow. Crops grow faster if the farmland they are planted in is hydrated. Using bone meal on crops also increases the speed of growth by randomly increasing their growth stage by 2 to 5.
Crops break if pushed by a piston or if their supporting farmland breaks or turns to dirt (e.g. by being trampled), dropping their usual drops.
If /gamerule mobGriefing is true, rabbits find mature carrot crops‌[Java Edition only] / carrot crops with growth stage greater than 1‌[Bedrock Edition only]. This reduces the growth stages by one, removing the crop completely when the growth stage reaches 0.
Breeding[edit | edit source]
Carrots can also be used to breed and attract pigs and rabbits.
Villagers can pick up carrot items to become willing, which allow them to breed. Villagers require 12 carrots to become willing.

Description
Fishing Rod or
Damaged Fishing Rod +
Carrot

The fishing rod must be diagonally above the carrot to craft the carrot on a stick.
Usage[edit | edit source]
Riding a pig[edit | edit source]
To use a carrot on a stick, the player must first saddle a pig, and ride it while holding the carrot on a stick. The pig then moves in the direction of the carrot. Also, if the player holds a carrot on a stick, all nearby pigs (but not rabbits[1]) follow the player, but they can't breed using a carrot on a stick.
To make the pig run faster, the player can press use while holding the carrot on a stick. This is called ""boosting"". Each boost costs 7 durability in Java Edition, or 2 durability in Bedrock Edition. If the carrot on a stick's durability is depleted, it turns back into a fishing rod.
The speed of a mounted pig is 2.42 m/s. Boosting a pig causes its speed to slowly ramp up until it reaches 2.15 times its normal speed, 5.20 m/s. Then speed slowly declines until the pig reaches normal speed again. The boost lasts between 140 and 980 game ticks (7 seconds and 49 seconds respectively), chosen randomly. No matter how many ticks the boost lasts, the average speed of pig during a full boost cycle is roughly 4.19 m/s. These boosted speeds are applied only while holding the carrot on a stick. These speeds are affected by the speed effect.

Java Edition
August 28, 2012 Dinnerbone released images of saddled pigs being controlled with carrots.[2] They start slow but end up traveling up to 5 blocks per second.[3] Wheat was considered as a ""fuel"" along with carrots,[4] and Dinnerbone eventually decided upon carrots.[5]
1.4.2 12w36a Added carrot on a stick.
The player does not get back a fishing rod once the carrot on a stick is used up.
12w37a Carrots on sticks now have a durability meter, and can be used to give saddled pigs a burst of speed when right-clicked. The carrot on a stick no longer needs to be held when pigs have the burst of speed.
12w38a Using up a carrot on a stick now returns a fishing rod.
1.4.6 12w50a A carrot on a stick can now be enchanted with Unbreaking via an enchanted book and an anvil.
1.8.2 pre7 Crafting a carrot on a stick now removes all enchantments on the original fishing rod.
1.9 16w05b Durability is no longer reduced merely by riding a pig, but only by using the speed boost.
1.13 17w47a Crafting a carrot on a stick no longer requires the fishing rod to be at full durability.[6]

Armor trimming[edit | edit source]
It is possible to upgrade armor with trims. This requires a smithing template, a chestplate, and an ingot or crystal (iron ingot, copper ingot, gold ingot, netherite ingot, emerald, redstone dust, lapis lazuli, amethyst shard, nether quartz, diamond, or resin brick).
These trims have no effect on the gameplay or strength of the armor.

Mob loot[edit | edit source]
Zombies, husks, skeletons, strays, bogged, piglins, and zombified piglins have a small chance to spawn wearing armor. There is a 8.5% chance (9.5% with Looting I, 10.5% with Looting II and 11.5% with Looting III) for the mob to drop the helmet they're wearing upon death unless they are spawned from an ominous trial spawner. The dropped helmet is usually badly damaged, and may be enchanted with enchantment levels 5-19.

Armor trimming[edit | edit source]
It is possible to upgrade armor with trims. This requires a smithing template, a chainmail helmet, and an ingot or crystal (iron ingot, copper ingot, gold ingot, netherite ingot, emerald, redstone dust, lapis lazuli, amethyst shard, nether quartz, diamond, or resin brick).
These trims have no effect on the gameplay or strength of the armor.

Charcoal is an item obtained by smelting logs or wood. It is used as fuel, or for crafting torches and campfires. Unlike coal, charcoal cannot be traded with villagers or crafted into a block of coal. Coal and charcoal also cannot stack together. It can be used as a substitute for coal, as both charcoal and coal have an equivalent duration when smelted.

This feature is available only in Minecraft Education or when enabling the ""Education"" option in Bedrock Edition.
Charcoal is one of the lab table ingredients needed to produce the heat block.

Fuel[edit | edit source]
When used in a furnace as a fuel, a piece of charcoal lasts 80 seconds (smelting up to 8 items), the same as coal. Charcoal used as fuel lasts more than 5 times longer than wood planks or wood logs used as fuel, being more efficient than any other use of wood for smelting in Java Edition, but outstripped by wooden slabs in Bedrock Edition.
Coal and charcoal are also the only fuels accepted by furnace minecarts. They provide three minutes of transit each.

↑ When creating an enchantment offer, the game uses a random enchantment level from 5 – 19. The enchantments are never treasure enchantments.
Usage[edit | edit source]
Chestplates can be placed in the chest slot of a player's inventory for activation.
Defense points[edit | edit source]
Defense points are each signified by chestplates in the armor bar above the health bar. 1 defense point is half of a chestplate in the armor bar. Each defense point reduces any damage dealt to the player, which is absorbed by armor by 4%, increasing additively with the number of defense points. Different materials and combinations of armor provide different levels of defense.
The following table shows the amount of defense points added by chestplates.
Material Defense points
Leather 3 ()
Golden 5 ()
Chainmail
Iron 6 ()
Diamond 8 ()
Netherite
Durability[edit | edit source]
The following table shows the amount of damage each piece of armor can absorb before being destroyed.
Any ""hit"" from a damage source that can be blocked by armor removes one point of durability from each piece of armor worn for every 4HP of incoming damage (rounded down, but never below 1). Damage taken that unenchanted armor does not protect against (such as falling or drowning) does not damage the armor, even if it is enchanted to protect against that type of damage. The following chart displays how many hits chest plates can endure.
Netherite armor is not damaged by lava or fire when worn.

A chestplate can be repaired in an anvil by adding units of the tiers' repair material, with each repair material restoring 25% the chestplate' maximum durability, rounded down. Two chestplates of the same tier can also be combined in an anvil. Both methods preserve the chestplate's enchantments.

Armor trimming[edit | edit source]
It is possible to upgrade armor with trims. This requires a smithing template, a chestplate, and an ingot or crystal (iron ingot, copper ingot, gold ingot, netherite ingot, emerald, redstone dust, lapis lazuli, amethyst shard, nether quartz, diamond, or resin brick).
These trims have no effect on the gameplay or strength of the armor.

Java Edition Classic
June 14, 2009 Notch discussed how armor would work in Survival mode: ""Two types of swords, two types of armor, two types of helmets. The basic versions require iron. The advanced versions require steel, which you make by combining iron and coal. Carrying swords, armor or helmets take up inventory slots, but otherwise have no penalty and work pretty much as you expect (prevent some damage, or cause more damage)"".
August 13, 2009 Notch tested chestplates on the human. They were merely aesthetic at the time and had no effect on gameplay.

Mining[edit | edit source]
See also: Tutorials/Chorus fruit farming
Chorus fruit can be obtained by breaking chorus plant blocks. Each block of chorus plant has a 50% chance to drop a chorus fruit. This is not affected by Fortune.[1]
Usage[edit | edit source]
Eating[edit | edit source]
To eat chorus fruit, press and hold use while it is selected in the hotbar. Eating one restores 4 () hunger and 2.4 hunger saturation.
Unlike most foods, chorus fruits can be eaten when the player has a full hunger bar.
Teleportation[edit | edit source]
The player may also be teleported: up to 16 attempts are made to choose a random destination within ±8 on all three axes in the same manner as enderman teleportation, with the exception that the player may teleport into an area only 2 blocks high, or one block tall if the player is crawling. The player does not land in the average centroid of the block, but rather to any position within an 8-block range. The player is teleported directly down to the ground regardless of the height it was used at if the player is too far from a valid destination.
The chorus fruit, unlike an ender pearl, can teleport the player through solid blocks. The algorithm tries to avoid fluids; the player cannot teleport into a space occupied by water or lava. However, the player can be teleported onto dangerous blocks such as fire, cacti and magma blocks.[2]
If a teleport succeeds, a sound similar to an enderman teleporting plays originating from the teleportation origin location. Chorus fruit has a cooldown of 1 second before being able to be used again. The cooldown is represented by a white overlay on the chorus fruit in the hotbar. The cooldown is applied to all chorus fruits items, including those in the player's inventory and containers.[3]
Eating chorus fruit removes all fall damage, regardless of the distance the player has fallen.
Eating chorus fruit may teleport the player into areas protected by bedrock, barrier blocks, or other blocks that are otherwise unbreakable in Survival mode. However, it cannot teleport the player onto the Nether roof.[4]
Chorus fruit is completely non-functional above the Nether roof.
Foxes can also eat chorus fruit and the teleportation effect works the same as with players.

Usage[edit | edit source]
The clock dial consists of two halves, a day side and a night side. The dial spins clockwise slowly to indicate the time of day, corresponding to the sun or moon's actual position in the sky. When the time of day changes suddenly, such as after sleeping or when /time is used, the clock dial spins rapidly to catch up. The player is able to sleep a few seconds after the clock shows exactly dusk.
The dial always shows the current in-game time when in the Overworld, regardless of where it appears. This includes a player's hand, an inventory slot, a crafting grid, an item frame, or even as a dropped item. For a clock to be mounted on a wall, an item frame is required.
Because there is no day/night cycle in the Nether or the End, clocks do not work properly in these dimensions. Instead, the dial rotates rapidly and randomly. Although clocks do not function in these dimensions, the actual daylight cycle does continue.
Piglins[edit | edit source]
Piglins are attracted to clocks and run toward any clock on the ground, and inspect it for 6 to 8 seconds before putting it in their inventory.

See also: Tutorials/Wither Skeleton farming
Wither skeletons have a 1⁄3 chance of dropping a single coal upon death. The maximum amount of coal is increased by 1 per level of Looting. The chance of a wither skeleton not dropping any coal can be found using the formula 2 / (Looting Level + 3). For example, Looting III gives a 1⁄3 chance of not dropping any coal. All other amounts have an equal chance of occurring.

Fuel[edit | edit source]
When used in a furnace as a fuel, a piece of coal lasts 80 seconds (smelting up to 8 items), like charcoal. Coal used as fuel lasts more than 5 times longer than wood planks or wood logs used as fuel, being more efficient than any other use of wood for smelting in Java Edition, but outstripped by wooden slabs in Bedrock Edition.
Coal and charcoal are also the only fuels accepted by furnace minecarts. They provide three minutes of transit each.

Obtaining[edit | edit source]
In Java Edition, cocoa beans are only obtained through the natural generation of cocoa pods, while in Bedrock Edition, they can also be found in bonus chests, from fishing inside the jungle, bamboo jungle and sparse jungle biomes and from trading with a wandering trader[verify].
Cocoa beans come from cocoa pods, which are found on the trunks of normal-sized naturally-generated jungle trees in jungle, bamboo jungle and sparse jungle biomes.
The block itself can be obtained by inventory editing or add-ons in Bedrock Edition.
Breaking[edit | edit source]
Cocoa pods can be mined with any item, but axes are the quickest. Fully grown cocoa pods drop 3 cocoa beans. Using a tool enchanted with Fortune does not increase the amount of cocoa beans dropped.

Trading[edit | edit source]
Wandering traders may sell 3 cocoa beans for an emerald during a trading in Bedrock Edition.[verify]
Usage[edit | edit source]
Farming[edit | edit source]
A somewhat efficient cocoa pod farm, minimizing space and wood use.
Main article: Tutorials/Cocoa bean farming
Placing cocoa beans on the side of a jungle log plants a new cocoa pod. The log does not need to be attached to a tree. A cocoa pod can be placed on jungle logs, jungle wood, stripped jungle logs and stripped jungle wood.
Cocoa has three stages of growth. During its first stage, the pod is small and green. In the second stage, the plant is bigger and colored tan. In its last stage, the pod is even larger and orange. The cocoa block has a 20% chance to grow a stage when receiving a random tick, giving it an average time of 5 minutes and 41 seconds per stage. When destroyed in the first two stages, the pod yields only one cocoa bean. When destroyed in the third stage, it gives 3 cocoa beans. Bone meal can be used to force the cocoa pod forward by one growth stage. Cocoa pods burst and drop their beans when struck by flowing water, pushed by a piston or if their log or wood are removed by any means.
Composting[edit | edit source]
Placing cocoa beans into a composter has a 65% chance of raising the compost level by 1.
Crafting ingredient[edit | edit source]
In Bedrock Edition, cocoa beans are accepted as a direct substitute of brown dye in many recipes.

Data history[edit | edit source]

Java Edition
1.3.1 12w19a Cocoa with values 12–15 is inaccessible normally, and use the texture of the dragon egg. This is due to the dragon egg texture being to the left of the ripe cocoa texture in terrain.png, as cocoa textures are arranged with the oldest on the left and the youngest on the right, resulting in the unusually ripe cocoa reading the dragon egg texture.
1.5 13w02a Due to textures being stored in individual files, cocoa beans with data 12–15 no longer have a texture to use, and now crash the game if a chunk containing one is loaded.
13w03a Cocoa with data values 12–15 now only crash the game if one is directly in the field of view.
13w10a Cocoa with data 12–15 now use the age 2 texture, resulting in a broken appearance, preventing previously mentioned crashes.
1.8 14w07a Cocoa of age 3 no longer has a model.
14w10a The missing model (which age 3 cocoa uses) has changed.
14w26a Cocoa with data 12–15 has been effectively removed from the game, as such blocks now convert to a proper value with /setblock. Loading worlds with existing out of range cocoa crash the game.
1.13 17w47a The different data values for the dye ID have been split up into their own IDs.
Prior to The Flattening, this block's and item's numeral ID were respectively 127 and 351.

Issues[edit | edit source]
Issues relating to ""Cocoa Beans"" or ""Cocoa Pod"" are maintained on the bug tracker. Issues should be reported and viewed there.
Trivia[edit | edit source]
Cocoa pods have a different hitbox for each size; however, the top is always 0.25 blocks below the top of the log it is on.
If a cocoa pod grows while the player is standing next to it, the player is forced into the appropriate form of suffocation prevention depending on available space.
In Bedrock Edition, the pixels on top of the fully grown pod are 8/7 the size of those on the side.[4][5]

Lodestone Compass: Yes (64)
A compass is an item that points in the horizontal direction of the Overworld's spawn point.
A lodestone compass is obtained by using a compass or lodestone compass on a lodestone, and instead points towards that lodestone's horizontal position.
If the target position of either type of compass is in a different dimension, or is a lodestone that has been broken, it will spin in random directions.

Usage[edit | edit source]
Both types of compass normally point in the horizontal direction of a specific position in the world and will do so when viewed in most ways; including in the inventory, when held by any player or entity or displayed in an item frame. They will also point towards their target position when viewed in the crafting table preview menu, even without being crafted.‌[Bedrock Edition only] The direction of the needle is relative to the player viewing it.
Normal compasses point toward the world spawn point in the Overworld. Using the /setworldspawn command to change the world spawn can change where normal compasses point.
If a compass or lodestone compass is used on a lodestone, it becomes a lodestone compass that points towards that lodestone. Compasses and lodestone compasses do not stack together, and only lodestone compasses that point towards the same lodestone stack together. All lodestone compasses have an enchantment visual effect to distinguish them from normal compasses.
A compass or lodestone compass will spin and point in random directions if it cannot find its target position. There are two causes for this:
If the compass is in a different dimension to its target position (e.g. a lodestone compass is in the Overworld but its target lodestone is in the Nether), its needle will spin randomly. Because of this, normal compasses only work in the Overworld (as their target position is the Overworld spawn point) and will always spin randomly in the Nether and End.
If a lodestone compass's target lodestone is broken, it will spin randomly, even if the lodestone is replaced in the same position. The only way to 'fix' a 'broken' lodestone compass is to use it on any lodestone to make it point towards it. However, if a lodestone compass is placed in a storage block, the lodestone can be broken and replaced without causing the compass to spin randomly, as long as the compass remains in storage while the lodestone is missing.
In Java Edition, uncrafted compasses viewed in the crafting table preview will always point straight forward and never at any particular position in the world.

Obtaining[edit | edit source]
Compounds can be obtained from the Creative inventory or by creating them in the compound creator. This is done by inserting a certain number of elements corresponding to the compound's chemical formula.
List of compounds[edit | edit source]
Icon Compound name Compound recipe Description Uses
Aluminium Oxide
2
3
Is only brown when dug up from the Earth and contaminated; actually white when pure. Can be electrolyzed to make aluminum metal. Also the main chemical in rubies and sapphires. Used to craft hardened glass.
Ammonia
3
a colorless highly irritating gas with a sharp suffocating odor. It dissolves easily in water to form ammonium hydroxide solution which can cause irritation and burns. Ammonia gas is easily compressed and forms a clear, colorless liquid under pressure. It is usually shipped as a compressed liquid in steel cylinders.

Villager gifts[edit | edit source]
In Java Edition, if the player has the Hero of the Village effect, a farmer villager may gift them a cookie.
Usage[edit | edit source]
Food[edit | edit source]
To eat a cookie, press and hold use while it is selected in the hotbar. Eating one restores 2 () hunger and 0.4 hunger saturation.
Parrots[edit | edit source]
In Java Edition feeding a cookie to a parrot kills the parrot instantly and gives the parrot the Poison effect as it dies.
In Bedrock Edition, feeding a cookie to a parrot gives the parrot the Fatal Poison effect instead, and the effect will kill the parrot within a few seconds.
Composting[edit | edit source]
Placing a cookie into a composter has an 85% chance of raising the compost level by 1.
Considering the high yield of cookies (8 cookies from 1 cocoa bean and 2 wheat) and the higher chance to successfully compost a cookie (85%), it is more efficient to craft cookies to compost rather than using separate ingredients. For example, 100 wheat and 50 cocoa beans, which in total could yield only 13.92 bone meal on average, could be crafted into 400 cookies to yield 48.57 bone meal on average.

Goat Horn

Natural generation[edit | edit source]
Copper horns were found in pillager outpost chests.
Usage[edit | edit source]
Copper horns were used to play sounds. They took one second to use and had a four second cooldown. There were ten variations of copper horns, and each of them played three different sounds: when looking up, crouching, or neither of those. In total, there were thirty different sounds that could be played using copper horns. The sound a copper horn played was based on multiple conditions, which are in order as follows:
If crouching, the bass tune was played.
Else, if looking up (by 45 degrees), the harmony tune was played.
Else, the melody tune was played.
Sounds[edit | edit source]
Sound names in the item tooltip are created using the harmony, melody, and bass sounds in that order.

Preview 1.18.30.29 Changed the texture of copper horns.
1.19.0 Preview 1.19.0.25 Removed copper horns.
Trivia[edit | edit source]
Copper horns were removed from the game as they didn't live up to the developers' design goals.[1]
In a twitter post, Kingbdogz mentioned that copper horns were intended more for social purposes than gameplay purposes.[2]
If a world that contained this item is loaded into a newer version, the horn disappears upon loading.

One thing it can do with the normal goat horn is that you can hear the sound from very far away, so it can be used to locate your friends on a server"" – @kingbdogz on X (formerly Twitter), March 16, 2022

Pillagers[edit | edit source]
When killed, a pillager has a small chance (8.5%) of dropping a loaded or unloaded crossbow with random durability; the drop rate increases by 1% per level of Looting: 9.5% with Looting I, 10.5% with Looting II and 11.5% with Looting III. The dropped crossbow can rarely (10% chance) be enchanted at level 5–19 regardless of being enchanted when it spawned.
Crossbows dropped by pillagers may have multiple enchantments, including duplicate enchantments on the same weapon.
Piglins[edit | edit source]
Piglins have a chance of wielding a crossbow upon spawning, and they also have a small chance (8.5%) of dropping a loaded or unloaded crossbow of random durability when killed; this rate increases by 1% per level of Looting: 9.5% with Looting I, 10.5% with Looting II and 11.5% with Looting III. It can rarely (10% chance) be enchanted at level 5–19 regardless of being enchanted when spawned.

Usage[edit | edit source]
Despite using iron ingots in their crafting recipe, crossbows cannot be smelted into iron nuggets.[1]
Weapon[edit | edit source]
Charging and shooting the crossbow in Bedrock Edition.
Crossbows are similar to bows, but take longer to load and are slightly more powerful, shooting farther with slightly higher accuracy. Alternatively, they can be loaded with a firework rocket, which flies in a straight line.
Load them by using them, which makes the player move at sneak speed. Unlike bows, the arrow or firework rocket can be fired only if the player releases the use button after the crossbow is loaded‌[Java Edition only] or if the crossbow finishes its loading animation‌[Bedrock Edition only]. At this point, it must be used a second time to fire its bolt.
Once it has reached full charge, the player's speed returns to normal. After that, shooting a charged crossbow does not delay any of the player's current actions like sprinting or swimming.
The crossbow can even be placed in another inventory slot or into an item frame without the arrow or firework rocket being unloaded or fired. A charged crossbow also remains charged after enchanting it with an enchantment table or with an anvil.
In order to use the crossbow, at least one arrow or firework rocket must be present in the inventory. The player can choose the type of arrow to fire based on its location in their inventory:
Arrows in the off-hand, or the selected hotbar slot if the crossbow is in the off-hand, are prioritized first.
If there are no arrows in the off-hand or selected hotbar slot, the arrow closest to slot 0 is selected.
Crossbows take 1.25 seconds (25 ticks) to load.
The player can load either an arrow, spectral arrow, tipped arrow (of any effect) or a firework (of any color/type).
Endermen teleport away from projectile paths, so they cannot be hit with crossbow arrows. However, they can still get harmed by firework rocket explosions, if they cannot detect the firework rocket.
Attack strength
Java Edition:
Damage Arrow Max firework
Minimum 7HP 11HP × 5.5
Average 9HP 14.5HP × 7.25
Maximum 11HP × 5.5 18HP × 9
Bedrock Edition
Always 9HP
Fireworks[edit | edit source]
Firework rockets can be fired by loading the crossbow only while holding the rockets in the off-hand. They fly at 32 m/s. Firework rockets with higher flight duration have a longer time before they explode and therefore travel farther. Firing a firework rocket uses 3 durability points per shot.
Firework rocket range
Minimum Average Maximum Gunpowder
32m (20 ticks) 40.8m (25.5 ticks) 49.6m (31 ticks) 1 ()
48m (30 ticks) 56.8m (35.5 ticks) 65.6m (41 ticks) 2 ()
64m (40 ticks) 72.8m (45.5 ticks) 81.6m (51 ticks) 3 ()
Firework rockets also work with the Multishot enchantment, enabling the player to shoot 3 firework rockets at a time. The increased durability usage stacks, resulting in 9 durability being consumed with each shot.
A shot firework rocket explodes instantly when it hits a mob or block.‌[Java Edition only] If the firework rocket has no explosion effect, it deals no damage. The explosion of a firework rocket deals 5HP to 6HP points of damage, with one firework star. The explosion has a radius of roughly 4 blocks, which is unaffected by the firework star's effect. Each additional firework star on the rocket deals an additional 1HP to 2HP points of damage, for a maximum of 11HP × 5.5 to 18HP × 9 with 7 firework stars. The flight duration of the firework increases the maximum range the firework can travel before exploding, but does not affect the damage output. Likewise, the damage remains the same regardless of any dyes used. The Piercing enchantment does not affect firework rockets shot from crossbows. Unlike an arrow shot from a bow, the firework does not slow down under water.

Issues[edit | edit source]
Issues relating to ""Crossbow"" are maintained on the bug tracker. Issues should be reported and viewed there.
Trivia[edit | edit source]
Alongside pillagers, crossbows were inspired by Minecraft Dungeons, even though they were added in the base game first.[2]
Crossbows enchanted with Quick Charge VI and above get stuck on the first frame on the recharging animation because the resulting charge time is negative, and the game never reaches the time markers that tell it to advance the animation or the reloading procedure itself. It is technically possible to charge such crossbows, but this would require overflowing the value that determines how long the crossbow has been charged. This takes such an amount of time that this is practically impossible: for example, charging a crossbow with Quick Charge VI would take 69.4 years to complete.
Although Piercing allows arrows to bypass shields, they cannot get through the wither's armor or a shulker's shell.
The crossbow's first-person loading animation in Bedrock Edition is different from Java Edition.
In real life, crossbows do not shoot the same arrows as bows, rather they shoot shorter, thicker, and oftentimes fletchless arrows (usually called ""bolts"") made to withstand the crossbow's increased power, which can shatter conventional arrows.

The debug stick is an item used to edit the block states of blocks. It is visually identical to a regular stick, but with a glint (as if enchanted).

Obtaining[edit | edit source]
The debug stick is obtainable via commands such as /give or /item, or the Creative inventory if the player has the appropriate permissions. It can be obtained only in worlds with commands on.
Usage[edit | edit source]
The debug stick can be used to change block states. Hitting the block allows players to select the block state key they wish to change, for an example, switching between the conditional and the facing block state keys for a command block. Using the block allows them to cycle through the valid values for the block state key, again as an example, the player can make the command block face, down, east, north, south, up, or west if they chose the facing block state key. Sneaking while hitting or using cycles through the block state keys or values in reverse order.
It is notable that using debug stick directly on an interactive block without sneaking uses the block itself instead of the stick.[1]
The debug stick cannot be used while in Survival or Adventure mode. It works only in Creative mode with cheats enabled. In modes other than Creative, it acts like a regular item — although when using it on a block, the player swings the stick as if interacting with it (but nothing happens).

Mining[edit | edit source]
See also: Diamond Ore § Natural generation
Diamond ore can be mined using an iron pickaxe or better. An ore drops a single diamond. If mined by any other tool, it drops nothing. If the pickaxe is enchanted with Fortune, it has a chance of dropping an extra diamond per level of Fortune, allowing for a maximum of 4 diamonds with Fortune III. If the ore is mined using a pickaxe enchanted with Silk Touch, it drops an ore block rather than a diamond. The ore is found at level 15 or lower, most commonly between -50 and -64; levels -58 and -59 are the preferred levels to mine at since they don't contain bedrock, as it starts spawning at -60.

Trivia[edit | edit source]
Unlike in Minecraft, newly mined diamonds in real life are rough, cloudy stones. The largest, purest ones are polished into crystal-clear gemstones, while the rest are used in industry for cutting and grinding.
In the April fools version Java Edition 2.0, diamond chickens can lay diamonds. This does not exist in newer versions, as it was a joke.

Usage[edit | edit source]
Breaking[edit | edit source]
Diamond axes can break wood-related blocks faster than other tools. Breaking a block costs 1 durability.[note 1]
↑ Blocks that break instantly don't use up durability.
Stripping[edit | edit source]
Using a diamond axe on a log, wood block, or block of bamboo turns it into a stripped log, stripped wood, or block of stripped bamboo, respectively. This costs 1 point of durability of the axe.
Copper blocks[edit | edit source]
Using a diamond axe on a waxed or oxidized copper block removes the wax if it has any, or otherwise remove a level of oxidization. This costs 1 point of durability.
Weapon[edit | edit source]
When used as a weapon, a diamond axe loses 2 durability points.
Java Edition[edit | edit source]
Attacking a shield user with an axe disables the use of the shield for 5 seconds. Vindicators, piglin brutes, or other mobs with commands always disable the player's shield. Damage done when using an axe as a weapon is more than that of a sword of the same tier, though they take longer than a sword to recover, resulting in lower DPS.
Attack Damage Attack Speed Recovery time DPS Lifetime damage inflicted[note 1]
9HP 1.0 1 second (20 game ticks) 9.0 7029HP × 3514.5
↑ The formula to find the total lifetime damage is ceil(durability ÷ 2) × damage per hit. The durability is halved then ceiled because axes take double durability when used as a weapon, and the last 1 durability can also deal damage. The formula also ignores enchantments and critical hits, and assumes each attack is performed at maximum charge.
Bedrock Edition[edit | edit source]
Diamond axes attack instantly with no cooldown and deal 7HP damage, but they lower the durability of armor and shields faster than a sword would do.

Armor trimming[edit | edit source]
It is possible to upgrade armor with trims. This requires a smithing template, a pair of boots, and an ingot or crystal (iron ingot, copper ingot, gold ingot, netherite ingot, emerald, redstone dust, lapis lazuli, amethyst shard, nether quartz, diamond, or resin brick).
These trims have no effect on the gameplay or strength of the armor.

Mob loot[edit | edit source]
Zombies, husks, skeletons, strays, bogged, piglins have a small chance to spawn wearing armor. There is a 8.5% chance (9.5% with Looting I, 10.5% with Looting II and 11.5% with Looting III) for the mob to drop the chestplate they're wearing upon death unless they are spawned from an ominous trial spawner. The dropped chestplate is usually badly damaged, and may be enchanted with enchantment levels 5-19.

Armor trimming[edit | edit source]
It is possible to upgrade armor with trims. This requires a smithing template, a chestplate, and an ingot or crystal (iron ingot, copper ingot, gold ingot, netherite ingot, emerald, redstone dust, lapis lazuli, amethyst shard, nether quartz, diamond, or resin brick).
These trims have no effect on the gameplay or strength of the armor.

1.0.0 Beta 1.9 Prerelease The armor protection behavior has been changed. Prior to this update, the total armor protection is based in this equation: (((total equipped armor damage reduction − 1) × (all equipped armor max damage − total equipped armor damage)) ÷ (total equipped armor max damage + 1)).

Diamond hoes are tools used to break plant-based blocks such as hay bales quicker and are also used to till dirt into farmland. They can also quickly break other blocks such as sculk-related blocks.

Usage[edit | edit source]
Main article: Hoe § Usage
Harvesting[edit | edit source]
Hoes are used to harvest certain plant-based or organic blocks more quickly. Breaking one of these blocks takes 1 durability.
Breaking any other block takes 0 durability if the block breaks instantly when broken by hand, or 1 otherwise.
Tilling[edit | edit source]
Hoes are used to turn dirt, grass blocks, and dirt paths into farmland. To till, press use on a grass or dirt block while holding a hoe. This does not work on mycelium or podzol,[1] nor does it work if there are other blocks on top of the targeted blocks, including snow layers or torches. However, mycelium and podzol can be first converted to dirt paths with a shovel, then tilled into farmland with a hoe.
Hoes can be used to convert coarse dirt into regular dirt by pressing use on the coarse dirt. Similar to tilling dirt, the space above the coarse dirt must be empty for it to be tilled.
Hoes can also be used on rooted dirt, which turns it into normal dirt, and yields a hanging roots item.
Tilling is effectively instantaneous, regardless of material, and uses 1 durability. Breaking blocks with a hoe uses 0 or 1 durability, depending on the block.
Hoes are unable to work on blocks with a plant on top, even if that plant could normally be placed on top of farmland without reverting it to dirt.[2]
Weapon[edit | edit source]
Hoes may be used as a weapon, although they deal only 1HP damage in Java Edition. In Bedrock Edition, hoes can do as much as a pickaxe in terms of damage. Hoes use 1 durability when used as a weapon.
In Java Edition, diamond hoes have an attack speed modifier 0 (refill in 0.25s).
Hoes always attack instantly in Bedrock Edition.

Trivia[edit | edit source]
Tilling a dirt block that has a dirt block on top of it changes it to farmland even though it cannot be used. If a hoe is used on a block horizontally adjacent to such a block, the first block reverts to dirt and the selected block is not tilled.
When a hoe breaks while tilling dirt, it does not display the tool breaking animation like on other tools, because tilling is not predicted client-side.

Usage[edit | edit source]
Only normal adult horses can wear armor; baby horses, donkeys, mules, and undead variants such as skeleton horses and zombie horses cannot be equipped with armor.
Protection[edit | edit source]
Horse armor can be equipped to horses either by manually placing it in its respective slot by pressing inventory while riding the horse (), or by using the horse with it.
There is a gradual increase in the defense given from a horse wearing the different types of armor. Note that golden horse armor provides more protection than iron horse armor, whereas the opposite is true for player armor. Diamond horse armor is the only horse armor type to provide any armor toughness.
Material Armor Armor toughness
Diamond 11 ( × 5.5) 2
If a horse dies while equipped with any horse armor, it drops its normal loot, a saddle (if it had one), and the horse armor.
Durability[edit | edit source]
Unlike player armor, horse armor does not have durability. This means a single horse armor can be used infinitely unless destroyed.
Enchanting[edit | edit source]
Unlike player armor, horse armor cannot be enchanted in Survival mode. However, in Java Edition Creative mode, horse armor can be used with an anvil to enchant with Thorns, Feather Falling, Protection, Fire Protection, Projectile Protection, Blast Protection, Curse of Binding, and Curse of Vanishing. Other enchantments can be applied, but they have no effect.

There is a 8.5% chance (9.5% with Looting I, 10.5% with Looting II and 11.5% with Looting III) for the mob to drop the leggings they're wearing upon death unless they are spawned from an ominous trial spawner.

Armor trimming[edit | edit source]
It is possible to upgrade armor with trims. This requires a smithing template, a leggings, and an ingot or crystal (iron ingot, copper ingot, gold ingot, netherite ingot, emerald, redstone dust, lapis lazuli, amethyst shard, nether quartz, diamond, or resin brick).
These trims have no effect on the gameplay or strength of the armor.

Usage[edit | edit source]
Main article: Pickaxe § Usage
Mining[edit | edit source]
A diamond pickaxe is used to break stone and metal-based materials faster. Breaking a block with a diamond pickaxe consumes one use (one durability point). No durability is consumed for blocks that have a hardness value of 0, such as torches and flowers.
A diamond pickaxe or better is required to mine the following blocks:
Obsidian
Crying Obsidian
Respawn Anchor
Ancient Debris
Block of Netherite
Weapon[edit | edit source]
Java Edition[edit | edit source]
All pickaxes have an attack speed modifier of -2.8, meaning they take about 0.85 seconds to recover. Diamond pickaxes do 5HP damage per attack, or 6 damage per second.
Bedrock Edition[edit | edit source]
All pickaxes attack instantly, with diamond pickaxes doing 6HP damage per attack.

Usage[edit | edit source]
Breaking[edit | edit source]
Main article: Sword § Breaking
A sword can also be used to destroy certain blocks 50% quicker, sometimes much quicker than with fists. Using a sword to destroy any block that doesn't break instantly by hand decreases its durability by 2; this includes bamboo, despite that the sword is the fastest tool for breaking it.[1]
If a sword is enchanted with Silk Touch, either using Creative or commands, cobwebs the sword destroys drop the cobwebs themselves instead of the usual string. This is due to the sword being classified as the proper tool for cobwebs.
Creative mode[edit | edit source]
In Creative mode, swords are unable to break blocks. However, they can still break placed entities such as minecarts, paintings, item frames,‌[Java Edition only] and armor stands.[2][3]
Attacking[edit | edit source]
Main article: Sword § Attacking
A diamond sword is used to deal damage to mobs and entities by attacking them. The diamond sword has 7HP base damage in Java Edition and 8HP base damage in Bedrock Edition, and can be enchanted to deal more damage. The following tables show how the Sharpness enchantment affects the damage dealt by the sword.
Extra damage of Sharpness enchantment[edit | edit source]
Sharpness extra damage

Bedrock Edition 1HP 2HP 3HP 5HP 6HP
Total damage of sword with Sharpness[edit | edit source]
The tables below assume that the attack is fully charged‌[Java Edition only], the target is not wearing armor, and neither the attacker nor the target has any effects.

Trivia[edit | edit source]
The diamond sword's original texture is a blue version of the sword from Notch's abandoned RPG, Legend of the Chambered, in which the sword looks like the old iron sword texture.
Plastic diamond and enchanted swords were once official Minecraft merchandise. However, they can no longer be purchased.[6][7]
In the game Transformice, a diamond sword can be found in the shop.

Drinks,"Drinks are a narrow selection of consumable items that the player can drink in an extremely similar manner to food. Drinks can be distinguished from food by the sounds they make upon consumption and the lack of particles emitted by consuming them. They also do not require the hunger bar to be depleted, and do not affect hunger or saturation values upon use (with the exception of honey bottles, which is considered both a drink and a food item).
Drinks are drunk by holding use while having the drink item selected in the hotbar or in the offhand‌[Java Edition only].

Dyes are a set of sixteen items used to change the color of wool, carpets, terracotta, concrete powder, glass, shulker boxes, beds, candles, bundles, the patterns on banners, firework stars, certain mobs, and text on signs and hanging signs. In Bedrock Edition they can also be used to dye water in a cauldron (which is thereafter used to dye leather armor); in Java Edition leather armor can be dyed directly. In Minecraft Education dyes can also be used to dye balloons and glow sticks.
In Bedrock Edition and Minecraft Education, bone meal, ink sacs, lapis lazuli, and cocoa beans can generally substitute for white dye, black dye, blue dye, and brown dye, respectively, in crafting recipes and for use in dyeing items or mobs. However, they have other important uses that aren't related to color, and are therefore not considered true dyes. They are mentioned in this article only in regard to their use as dyeing agents; see their individual articles for complete information about them.

Banner patterns[edit | edit source]
Main article: Banner § Patterns
Dye is used to add a banner pattern to a banner. Each pattern uses 1 dye, which also determines the color of that pattern.
Dyeing armor[edit | edit source]
A graph showing all combinations of two dyes on a leather tunic. In total, leather armor can be colored in 5,713,438 possible colors[1][2]
Leather armor, wolf armor, and leather horse armor can be dyed:
In Java Edition, armor is dyed by crafting it and dyes together on a crafting table.
In Bedrock and Legacy Console editions, armor is dyed by using it on a cauldron filled with dyed water. This consumes 1 layer of water but does not change the color of the water.
The armor can be undyed by using it on a cauldron with undyed water. This changes the water's color to the color of the armor and changes the armor to have no dye color.
It is possible to put more than one dye alongside the armor. Armor can be dyed multiple times with previous colors affecting the final outcome. Colored armor can be reverted to their original color using a cauldron with undyed water.
The game has a specific formula for calculating the color of dyed armor: each color, in the RGBA color model, has a red value, green value, blue value and layer opacity or alpha value. For each dye in the crafting grid, and the armor itself (if it is already dyed), the red, green, and blue values are added to running totals. In addition, a running total of the highest value (be it red, green, or blue) is also kept. After this, each total is divided by the number of colors used. This effectively produces the average red, green, blue, and maximum values. The maximum value of the average RGB values is also calculated. Finally, the average maximum value is divided by the maximum of the average RGB values. The average RGB values are then used as the final color and the modified average maximum value used as the layer opacity value. This procedure can be summed up with the following pseudocode:
set all ""total"" variables to 0
set numberOfColors to 0
for each color:
 set totalRed to: totalRed + redValue
 set totalGreen to: totalGreen + greenValue
 set totalBlue to: totalBlue + blueValue
 set totalMaximum to: totalMaximum + (max of redValue, greenValue, blueValue)
 set numberOfColors to: numberOfColors + 1

set averageRed to: totalRed / numberOfColors
set averageGreen to: totalGreen / numberOfColors
set averageBlue to: totalBlue / numberOfColors
set averageMaximum to: totalMaximum / numberOfColors

set maximumOfAverage to: max of averageRed, averageGreen, averageBlue
set alphaFactor to: averageMaximum / maximumOfAverage

set resultRed to: averageRed
set resultGreen to: averageGreen
set resultBlue to: averageBlue
set resultLayerOpacity to: alphaFactor
Due to the way this formula works, the resulting color can never be darker than the average of the input colors and is often lighter and more saturated. Of course, the resulting color can never be lighter or more saturated than the lightest or most saturated input color. In addition, this formula never creates an RGB value higher than 255 (which would be invalid in the 8-bit RGB color model). Finally, this formula does not allow for every possible color to be obtained. Therefore, not all dyed armors are obtainable.
If armor is renamed on an anvil, it retains its name when dyed or undyed.

Dyeing sheep[edit | edit source]
Dyes can be used on sheep to change the color of the wool. Shearing a colored sheep drops the corresponding color of the wool, and the sheep retains the color when the wool regenerates. Breeding colored sheep produces a lamb colored as one of the parent sheep, or a color resulting from the combination of both parents' color. The color combining follows the same rules that dyes use – red and yellow sheep produce an orange lamb, but a blue and yellow sheep cannot create a green lamb. The unlimited reproduction of colored sheep makes dyeing and shearing sheep infinitely more efficient than just dyeing wool directly.
Dyeing collars[edit | edit source]
Dye can also be used on a tamed wolf or cat to change the color of its collar from the default red to the color of the dye.
Dyeing signs[edit | edit source]
Dye can be used on a sign or a hanging sign to change the text color. In Bedrock Edition, ink sacs cannot be used for this purpose; black dye must be used to change the text to black.
Dyeing water inside cauldrons[edit | edit source]
This feature is exclusive to Bedrock Edition. 
Water can be dyed in a cauldron by holding any dye in the hand and pressing use on a cauldron filled with water.
Trading[edit | edit source]
Apprentice, journeyman and expert-level shepherd villagers buy 12 of any of the dyes for an emerald.
Color values[edit | edit source]
The ""color codes"" are used to determine the color imparted on sheep, wolf and cat collars, firework stars, beacon beams, and dyed leather armor, leather horse armor and wolf armor. The hex value is shown in the extended tooltips of dyed armor; however, to set the color using an NBT data tag in a command, the decimal value must be used instead. The color values for firework stars are slightly different. Color codes are usually encoded using the corresponding numeric id, although e.g. signs store the color name instead to represent text color.

Trivia[edit | edit source]
Players can obtain each one of every color with 1 cocoa bean, 2 yellow dye, 2 ink sac, 3 green dye, 4 lapis lazuli, 4 red dye, and 6 bone meal (2 bones).
The dyed sheep breeding behavior mirrors Lamarck's theory, in which the organisms evolve inheriting the external changes and adaptations of the previous generation, transmitting them to their offspring.
In Bedrock Edition, tertiary colors, along with their regular crafting recipes, can be crafted with primary colors. E.g.: Magenta can be crafted with one rose red and two bone meals.
The colors of the dyes match the chat colors in color codes except for brown (dye only), light aqua, and gold (color codes only).
The texture for light blue dye still uses the color from prior to the 1.12 World of Color update.[3]

An egg is an item that can be used to craft food items, or thrown for a chance to spawn baby chickens on impact. ‌In Java Edition 1.21.5 and Bedrock Edition 1.21.70[upcoming], they have three variants based on the variant of the corresponding chicken: the standard egg for temperate chickens, brown eggs for warm chickens, and blue eggs for cold chickens.

Every adult chicken lays an egg item every 5–10 minutes, except for those that are or were a part of chicken jockeys. The theoretical average would be expected at 1 egg every 7.5 minutes (9000 game ticks). ‌In Java Edition 1.21.5 and Bedrock Edition 1.21.70[upcoming], the type of egg being laid depends on the chicken variant; temperate chickens lay normal eggs, cold chickens lay blue eggs, and warm chickens lay brown eggs.
A fox has a 3% chance of spawning with a normal egg in its mouth, which it drops upon death. Alternatively, a player dropping a food item causes the fox to drop the egg.

Combat[edit | edit source]
Players are able to throw eggs and deal knockback to mobs (but not other players‌[JE only][1]‌[until JE Combat Tests]), but no damage is dealt, similar to a snowball. Likewise, throwing eggs at neutral mobs provokes them. Eggs can also be fired from dispensers and are affected by gravity. Eggs thrown through fire or lava in Bedrock Edition catch fire, and set fire to entities they hit.
Spawning chickens[edit | edit source]
When thrown by a dispenser or by pressing the use button, an egg has a 1⁄8 (12.5%) chance of spawning a chick. If this occurs, there is a 1⁄32 (3.125%) chance of spawning three additional chicks (on average, 1 out of every 256 eggs spawns 4 chicks). In other words, whenever an egg is thrown, there is a 31⁄256 chance of spawning 1 chick and a 1⁄256 chance of spawning four chicks.
‌In Java Edition 1.21.5 and Bedrock Edition 1.21.70[upcoming], the chick variant depends on which egg variant was thrown; regular eggs hatch temperate chicks, blue eggs hatch cold chicks, while brown eggs hatch warm chicks.
The expected value of the number of chicks an egg produces is 35⁄256 or 13.7%. This means that on average, a chick is spawned every 7.3 eggs, a stack of 16 eggs spawns 2.188 chicks, and a full inventory including the hotbar and off-hand (37 × 16 = 592 eggs) is expected to spawn approximately 81 chicks.
For the purposes of establishing a new chicken farm with eggs alone, the probability P for at least 2 chicks to spawn after throwing n eggs can be calculated using the following formula:
P
=

When throwing 16 eggs, there is a 62% chance of spawning at least two chicks. When throwing 32 eggs, the probability rises to 92%
An average of 450 seconds elapses for a chicken to lay another egg. Accounting for all probabilities, the average chicken produces 1.09 chickens per hour when all the eggs it lays are thrown.

Trivia[edit | edit source]
Eggs break mid-fall if hit by another projectile; the chance of spawning a chick is not affected.
Throwing an egg at a nether portal breaks the egg when it hits the portal.
A thrown egg faces toward the player in first-person view, while it appears rotated horizontally in third-person view. This is the case for all throwable items (ender pearls, eggs, snowballs, and all throwable potions).

Elytra (singular form elytron) are endgame equipment found only in end ships in the outer islands of the End. While worn as torso armor, they allow gliding by pressing jump while midair. Firework rockets can be used as propulsion while gliding, allowing for true flight.

Obtaining[edit | edit source]
Natural generation[edit | edit source]
Elytra are found only in end cities in item frames in the treasure room of the end ship. A shulker guards the elytra and the ship's two loot chests.
Usage[edit | edit source]
Elytra are equipped in the chestplate slot, either by placing the item directly in the slot, by pressing use item while held in hand, or by firing a point-blank dispenser at a target. They are gray in color by default, but they adopt the design of any cape the player is wearing. They maintain their in-world texture design even when they're broken or enchanted.
Flying[edit | edit source]
To fly, the player must press the jump key while falling, and the elytra spread apart like a beetle's wings. The player can aim their view around to turn or adjust their pitch. Losing altitude increases speed, and gaining altitude decreases speed. Firework rockets can be used to increase speed. Additionally, speed is quickly lost from sharp changes in direction.
The player can take fall damage while flying unless they land at a shallow angle or a low enough speed. The critical, damaging angle is about 50°. Additionally, colliding with a vertical surface while gliding too fast causes damage to the player and their armor. When a player dies in this way, they receive the death message ""<player> experienced kinetic energy"". Note that colliding with a horizontal surface does not cause this type of damage, so the player takes no damage when flying into a ceiling. The amount of damage caused by a collision is determined by the formula:
damage
=
1
0
×
(
change in horizontal velocity
)
−
3
A safe and simple cruise with the highest travel distance can be achieved by aiming directly at the horizon while at the glide's altitude limit. The player's speed is slow enough to allow them time to do other things during a long flight, like sort out their inventory.
In Creative mode or when the ""mayfly"" ability has been given, the player can alternatively hold the jump key to fly up,‌[Bedrock Edition only] or double press the jump key to move around freely.
Flight can be stopped by pressing the jump key.‌[Bedrock Edition only]
Speed and altitude[edit | edit source]
Elytra have a minimum speed of about 7.2 m/s (obtained by gliding at the altitude cap with a strong upward pitch of 30°). If the diver drops to 0 speed, they quickly get accelerated back up to at least this minimum. The diver can increase speed by choosing to descend faster, but afterward, they do not regain nearly as much altitude. In the real world, drag increases with speed, and drag, in turn, slows the aircraft; Minecraft mimics this. To glide from cliff to cliff, a player's best bet is to aim slightly above the horizon.
Sharp turns are a fast way to lose speed. Quicker turns cause greater losses, while gentle movements have small effects. Making a hairpin turn can actually be used for making high-speed landings safe as well as for precise landings on small targets like rooftops. The player aims to glide just above the target, then as they're right over it they immediately reverse directions, then they make readjustments as necessary.
The lowest rate of altitude loss is about 1.5 m/sec, obtained by gliding at the altitude cap with a slight upward pitch (12° or 15°).
To get the best possible glide ratio (and thus the furthest distance out of their altitude), the diver pilot should aim directly at the horizon. This ratio is about 9.47 to 1.
Slow Falling potions greatly decrease the player's vertical (fall) speed, which also greatly decreases their horizontal speed (clearly, it depends on the vertical fall rate, as one might expect from flight modeling). The net result is that the player flies extremely slowly - but their elytra still takes durability damage at the usual rate (1 durability per second without Unbreaking). The Feather Falling enchantment does not affect elytra speed and does not reduce fall damage from hitting things with elytra.
It is possible to calculate the glide range by dividing the altitude by tan of the glide angle (altitude/tan(glide angle)). For example, if the player glides from an altitude of 64 blocks above ground with a glide angle of 15 degrees, they can glide for 237 blocks (assume that they are on superflat), since floor(64 / tan(15)) is 237.
Stalling[edit | edit source]
Trying for too high a pitch reduces the player's lift. At a pitch of 30° above the horizon, the player has the lowest possible airspeed of 7.2 m/sec. Above that, the player might be considered to be in a stall. Increasing the pitch gets closer to a free-fall, and stalled flight at 60° is enough to cause fall damage. Stalling at 90° is a true free-fall.
Recovering from a stall is done by readjusting to any safe pitch as quickly as the player likes. This can be just changing to look at the horizon.
Powered flight[edit | edit source]
Firework rockets are used for speed boosts while gliding.
Firework rockets can be used for propulsion during flight by placing it in either hand and using. Using a firework rocket while gliding quickly maximizes the player's speed for a time similar to the rocket's flight duration.
If the rocket is equipped with firework stars, it explodes at the end of its flight, inflicting damage based on the number of stars.
It is possible to gain altitude during powered flight. This makes it possible to glide for extreme distances and had been used extensively by far lands/World Border challenges.
Durability[edit | edit source]
A broken pair of elytra.
Durability decreases by one point each second when gliding. A pair of elytra has 432 durability, allowing 7 minutes and 12 seconds of gliding time without enchantments, providing more than 10,000 blocks of transport distance. It is possible to apply the Unbreaking enchantment using an anvil and an enchanted book, which affects the elytra, in the same way it does to tools. Unbreaking III increases elytra's flight time to about four seconds per durability point, a total of 28 minutes and 48 seconds.
When the durability reaches 1, elytra stop working until they are repaired, adopting a tattered texture in the inventory. The damage ends at durability 1, so they can never fully break.

Issues[edit | edit source]
Issues relating to ""Elytra"" are maintained on the bug tracker. Issues should be reported and viewed there.
Trivia[edit | edit source]
In reality, elytra are not used for flight. They are the tough forewings of beetles and earwigs that cover the wings they actually use for flight. However, like Minecraft elytra, some beetles can use them for gliding.
A flying player has a shorter hitbox than usual: A 0.6 block cube centered on the player's feet.
In Java Edition if the player glides into deep water with elytra equipped, the animation does not stop, giving it the appearance of a swimming animation.[5] The animation stops once the player touches the ground. Additionally, firework rockets can be used with elytra underwater with a short boost duration.
Elytra do not deactivate when the player flies into lava.[5]
Elytra can be equipped onto some mobs using commands. This has no effect unless the mob has the FallFlying tag set to 1b. Except for squids, mobs glide forward, unable to control the movement before landing, at which time they regain their AI.
Exceptions to this are squids as the squid's AI causes it to attempt swimming in midair, making it fall straight down because it conflicts with the elytra mechanics.
Because chickens fall slowly, they can move more distance.
Endermen, tamed wolves and tamed cats that are not sitting cannot teleport until they hit the ground.
Because mobs do not regain control until they hit the ground, vexes fall until they die or despawn as they cannot touch the ground.
Mobs capable of flying, such as parrots or vexes can steer in air, though they cannot travel up or down. Dolphins also have this ability.
4J Studios created an elytra-centered tutorial map for console edition when elytra were first introduced to this platform, this map is themed as ""ruins of an ancient civilization of Minecraft worshippers"" and showcases the new amplified terrain generation. This map can be seen behind the scenes.[6] On 28 March 2017, 4J Studios added an elytra-themed Mini Games for Legacy Console Edition called ""Glide;"" it consists of Time Attack and Score Attack mode.[7][8]
A player who jumps with both elytra and the Slow Falling effect travels slightly upward, which is a cheap but time-consuming alternative to fireworks and Riptide-enchanted tridents.
Mojang has considered the suggestion of combining elytra with a chestplate, but eventually decided against it, stating that elytra taking up armor is an intentional decision of game balancing.[9]
In Minecraft is turning 15, Zuri can be seen wearing elytra. However, instead of the model, they're wearing the item itself, making the elytra disporportionately small.

Obtaining[edit | edit source]
Mining[edit | edit source]
Emerald ore drops one emerald when mined using an iron pickaxe or better. If the pickaxe is enchanted with Fortune, it may drop an extra emerald per level of Fortune, up to a maximum of 4 emeralds with Fortune III. If the ore is mined using a pickaxe enchanted with Silk Touch, it drops itself in ore form instead of as an emerald.

Trading[edit | edit source]
Main article: Trading
Emeralds can be obtained by trading with villagers, since they are the currency that villagers use for trading. Villagers either buy or sell specific goods for emeralds. If the Villager Trade Rebalance experiment is enabled, wandering traders can also trade emeralds for certain items.
Mob loot[edit | edit source]
Vindicators and evokers drop 0–1 emeralds upon death. Looting increases the maximum emerald drop by one per level, for a maximum of 4 emeralds with Looting III.
Foxes that are holding emeralds also have a chance of 100% to drop the emerald they are holding upon death. Alternatively, the player can drop a food item to entice the fox to drop the emerald without killing it.
In Bedrock Edition, vindicators and pillagers spawned from raids can drop 0–1 emeralds. Depending on difficulty, vindicators and pillagers spawned from raids also have a chance of dropping additional emeralds. There is a 65% chance of dropping on Easy and Normal, and an 80% chance of dropping on Hard. If this additional drop condition is met, different emerald counts can drop with different chances. There is a 10⁄39 chance to drop an additional 0–1 emeralds, a 5⁄39 chance to drop an additional 2–3, and a 2⁄39 chance to drop an additional 4–5.
In Bedrock Edition, with Looting III, it is possible for a vindicator in a raid to drop up to 16 emeralds upon death (vindicator drops + raid drops + an additional drop).

a b c d The enchantment is chosen randomly with equal chance of any enchantment type occurring (except for Soul Speed, Swift Sneak, and Wind Burst) and equal chance to get any level of the enchantment, meaning high-level enchantments are as likely as low-level enchantments. It is possible for a librarian to sell the same book more than once. The price in emeralds depends on the enchantment level and ""treasure"" status. The minimum price of a book is given by 2 + 3 * (enchantment level), while the maximum price is 6 + 13 * (enchantment level). The possible values are 5–19 emeralds for Lvl I, 8–32 for Lvl II, 11–45 for Lvl III, 14–58 for Lvl IV, and 17–71 for Lvl V. For treasure enchantments the price is doubled. The cost is capped at 64 emeralds. All values below this cap are equally probable.
The price ranges between 5-64 emeralds per book. Based on the level of the enchantment and whether it is classified as a ""treasure enchantment"" (meaning they are not obtainable by enchanting, e.g. Mending), which doubles the cost, or not a price is determined.
Cost of enchanted books based on their level
Level Lowest price Highest price
I (1) 5 19
II (2) 8 32
III (3) 11 45
IV (4) 14 58
V (5) 17 71 (capped at 64)
They may contain any available enchantment (except Soul Speed, Swift Sneak, and Wind Burst) at any available level. See trading notes for more information on enchantments and prices.
Drops[edit | edit source]
This feature is exclusive to Bedrock Edition. 
Vindicators and pillagers that spawn from raids have a small chance to drop an enchanted book with a level 30 enchantment, which may be a treasure enchantment.
Enchanting[edit | edit source]
An enchanted book with multiple high level enchantments.
An enchanted book with multiple enchantments that can be applied to the same item.
Players can create an enchanted book by enchanting a book on an enchantment table. Books have a decreased chance of getting multiple enchantments (specifically, if multiple enchantments would be added, then one is removed at random), and have a lower ""enchantability level"" than most other items. Treasure enchantments such as Mending cannot be obtained from an enchantment table.
Bartering[edit | edit source]
Players can barter with piglins by using or throwing gold ingots, and doing so has a 5⁄459 chance for piglins to give the player an enchanted book with any level of Soul Speed. Soul Speed enchanted books are obtainable only through bartering or chest loot inside a bastion remnant. They cannot be obtained through enchanting, trading, or fishing.
Usage[edit | edit source]
See also: Anvil mechanics
In Survival, enchanted books are the only method to obtain certain enchantments on certain tools, such as Unbreaking on shields. Enchanted books have a shine effect on their sprite.
To use an enchanted book, the player must place an item in the first slot in an anvil, and a book in the next. In order to complete the enchantment, the player must have the required amount of experience. Note that using an enchanted book gets significant discounts at the anvil. Enchanted books themselves can be combined to create a single book with increased or multiple enchantments, similar to combining tools or weapons.
When combining items, the compatible enchantments from the book in the second slot are transferred to the item from the first slot, keeping the highest level of any type. If two enchantments have the same level and a higher level is available, they combine into the next level. If a book is applied to an item that can't take all of its spells, the appropriate spells are transferred, while the unusable ones are lost. Enchanted books are single-use.
Enchanted books do not exhibit their enchantment. For example, a book with Sharpness IV as an enchantment does no more damage than an un-enchanted book, or any non-weapon item, would when used as a weapon. An exception is the Fire Aspect book which can ignite TNT and light campfires and the Fortune book if the block mined can be broken by fist.‌[Bedrock Edition only]
Available items[edit | edit source]
See also: Enchantments
Enchanted books can enchant the usual items that can be enchanted at an enchanting table, but unlike an enchanting table, they are able to boost enchantments such as Sharpness or Thorns to their maximum power, and may apply the following enchantments to items (the table displays only netherite tools and armor, but any type can be enchanted):
Enchantment Items not enchantable
at an enchanting table Note
Efficiency Increases mining speed
Thorns Inflicts damage on attacker
Unbreaking

Increasing durability on enchanted tools/armors
Frost Walker Creates walkable ice layer over water
Mending

Uses XP orbs to repair damaged tools/weapons/armors
Curse of Binding
Prevents removal of cursed item
Curse of Vanishing



Cursed item is destroyed upon death
Soul Speed The wearer's speed is increased when walking on soul sand or soul soil.
Swift Sneak The wearer's sneaking speed is increased.
Wind Burst A burst of wind is created upon impact.
Creative mode[edit | edit source]
The player can enchant any item with any enchantment in Creative mode, allowing any applied effects to exhibit themselves.‌[Java Edition only] For example, a stick can be enchanted with Silk Touch to allow the player to successfully dig grass blocks. The enchanted item can still be used in Survival mode without any loss of enchantments.
Enchantments that are normally incompatible are still incompatible; for example, Piercing and Multishot cannot be both applied to the same item, even in Creative mode.
If a block is enchanted, it loses the enchantment upon being placed in the world.
Disenchanting[edit | edit source]
Disenchanting an enchanted book at a grindstone yields a normal book and some experience depending on the quality of the book. However, just like any other item that can hold enchantments, the Curse of Vanishing and Curse of Binding enchantments cannot be removed from a book.
Chiseled bookshelf[edit | edit source]
Using the chiseled bookshelf while having an enchanted book in the main hand puts the book inside the chiseled bookshelf. Hoppers also interact with the chiseled bookshelf to insert and remove books, allowing it to act as an item filter in various mob farms.

History[edit | edit source]

Java Edition
1.3.1 12w21a Added a second tier of the golden apple that provides greater benefits, similar to the golden apple before 1.1.
It grants Resistance (5 minutes) and Fire Resistance (5 minutes) in addition to Regeneration IV (30 seconds). However, it only restores 4 () hunger points.
It can be crafted with 8 blocks of gold and one apple. Since apples are also renewable, enchanted golden apples are renewable, as opposed to pre-1.1 golden apples.
It shines like an enchanted item and features a purple tooltip, but it is simply named ""Golden Apple"". In response, the standard golden apple lost its glint, and its tooltip was changed to cyan.

Trivia[edit | edit source]
The damage tag of an enchanted apple obtained in Bedrock Edition is 1, although setting it to 0 makes no difference.
In Java Edition, if a regular golden apple is enchanted using an anvil in Creative mode, it has a glint like an enchanted golden apple and its rarity color turns purple, but the effect when consumed remain the same as that of a regular golden apple.
Continuously eating enchanted golden apples allows the player to survive in the void until all the apples are consumed.

An end crystal is an entity that can be crafted or found on the End's main island, where it heals the ender dragon. It can be placed only on obsidian or bedrock, and it explodes instantly when attacked or damaged in most ways.

Spawning[edit | edit source]
Natural generation[edit | edit source]
An end crystal is found atop each obsidian pillar on the central island of the End, each on top of a bedrock block. There are 10 end crystals in total, two of which are protected in ""cages"" of iron bars. All end crystals respawn one after another as the respawning process of the ender dragon starts.

Usage[edit | edit source]
Healing the ender dragon[edit | edit source]
Their primary purpose is to recharge the health of the ender dragon, who gains a charge from the nearest crystal within a cuboid extending 32 blocks from the dragon in all directions. The dragon is healed 1HP each half-second. If multiple ender dragons are spawned, an end crystal can affect multiple dragons at the same time. Entities and blocks neither obstruct the healing beam nor diminish its power.
Respawning the ender dragon[edit | edit source]
How to arrange end crystals on the exit portal to respawn the ender dragon.
As items, end crystals may be placed on bedrock and obsidian, if the two blocks above the bedrock or obsidian block are air or replaceable blocks and no other entities intersect the area. When an end crystal is placed in the End, a fire block is created at the end crystal location. If four are placed on the end exit portal, one on each of the flat sides, the crystals respawn the original end crystals on the obsidian pillars, resurrect the dragon, and then explode. The top of each pillar also explodes, destroying any player-placed blocks. This happens even if TNT explosions are turned off in settings.
If the exit portal is ever broken for any reason, end crystals can still be placed on obsidian blocks with the same location as the exit portal.
Explosions[edit | edit source]
End crystals explode when attacked or damaged in most ways, even by attacks that normally do zero damage. They are not affected by exploding fireworks, and if damaged by an explosion, they disappear instead of exploding.‌[Java Edition only][1] The end crystal's explosion has an explosion strength of 6, the same as a charged creeper. The end crystal's fire often remains after the crystal explodes. Any ender dragon charging from the crystal when it is destroyed takes 10HP damage.
In Java Edition, an end crystal's explosion can be blocked by a shield.
Although an ender dragon damages most blocks and entities in its path, it cannot destroy end crystals.
Placing water on the end crystal neutralizes the blast effect, but not the damage or knockback.
End crystals with obsidian or bedrock below them do not damage blocks below them when they explode, due to the explosion center being at the bottom of the end crystal.
In Bedrock Edition, setting the game rule mobGriefing to false prevents the end crystal from destroying any blocks.
Beams[edit | edit source]
The end crystal shoots a beam at the ender dragon and heals it when the dragon is within range. This beam can be manually created using the command /data merge entity @e[type=end_crystal,limit=1] {BeamTarget:{X:0, Y:0, Z:0}}. The beam can be pointed in any direction, allowing it to mark locations or objects.
Properties[edit | edit source]
A baseless end crystal.
End crystals are of two kinds: the ones with a base beneath them are created either by game mechanism or by the /summon command; while the base-less ones are created by players by manually placing the crystal items on top of obsidian or bedrock.
The base appears to be made of bedrock, with a crystal hovering over it. While in the End, a crystal continually generates fire at its current position, one block above the base (directly on top of the block the base is embedded in), replacing any other block at that location. This fire is capable of spreading.
The end crystal entity is not solid and can be walked through freely. End crystals can be pushed by pistons, but they explode if moved while on fire. Because fire is checked only when an entity moves, end crystals do not normally take damage from their own fire unless moved.

Java Edition
1.0.0 Beta 1.9 Prerelease 6 Added ender crystals.
1.2.1 12w04a Previously, ender crystals could be spawned using spawn eggs with ID 200 (in a server, these were created using /give 383 1 200). The spawned crystal would be positioned where a natural crystal would be if there was a bedrock block at the location.

Trivia[edit | edit source]
According to Jeb, the reason behind the current crafting recipe using glass as opposed to chorus fruit or any materials introduced in 1.9 is as a means for players to craft end crystals in older worlds that the dragon has already been killed in.[5]
A historical rendition of the beacon block featured an animated entity within it, which resembled a yellow miniaturized end crystal. The bedrock platform of the end crystal entity would also render below the beacon, though this would normally be hidden within the block below.
Using a piston to push an end crystal's fire into an end portal block deletes the end portal block. However, natural portal blocks regenerate if the end crystal is moved.

Bartering[edit | edit source]
Piglins have a 10⁄459 (2.18%) chance to barter 2–4 ender pearls when given a gold ingot.
Usage[edit | edit source]
Ender pearls can be thrown by pressing use. After it is thrown, the ender pearl is consumed, and the player teleports to where it lands, taking 5HP fall damage. Wearing armor enchanted with Protection and/or Feather Falling reduces the damage taken from the ender pearl. If a player dies from fall damage due to throwing an ender pearl, the death message says ""<player> hit the ground too hard"".
Ender pearls have a small cone of travel; they do not all follow the same path when thrown in the same direction. The direction and velocity of ender pearl throws is slightly randomized. They can travel about 30 blocks‌[Java Edition only]/45 blocks‌[Bedrock Edition only] when thrown straight up, and up to 54 blocks forward when thrown at an optimum launch angle of ~35° (on even ground).
The thrower's vertical velocity influences the throw. Hence timing a throw with a jump can increase the throwing range to 42 blocks when thrown straight up and 64 blocks forward at a 35° angle. Throwing while falling significantly decreases the range. Ender pearls collide with all minecart types, boats and end crystals, and travel through nether portals and end portals. Ender pearls that fall into the void disappear, and do not trigger the player to teleport. However, ender pearl entities (instead of dropped items) are not destroyed by lava and teleport the player to the bottom of lava pools/lava oceans.
Ender pearls have a cooldown of one second before they can be used again. The cooldown is shown in the hotbar by a white overlay on the ender pearl that shrinks and must disappear before the player can use it again. If there are other inventory or hotbar slots containing ender pearls, they are covered with the white overlay as well.[1]
Ender pearls can be thrown into end gateways to reach the outer islands of the End. They can also be thrown into the exit portal to reach the player's spawn point.
If the player throws an ender pearl and then dies while the pearl is in a loaded chunk before impact, the pearl disappears and the player is not teleported; in Java Edition, the pearl does not vanish upon the player's death if the game rule enderPearlsVanishOnDeath is set to false.
Stasis chamber[edit | edit source]
Ender pearls are affected by bubble columns. An ender pearl can remain afloat on top of an upward bubble column, allowing it to be stored indefinitely‌[Java Edition only]. A mechanism can then be triggered to make the ender pearl hit a solid surface (e.g. by closing a trapdoor), teleporting the thrower back to the setup wherever they are.
Chunk loading[edit | edit source]
Main article: Chunk § Chunk loading
An ender pearl creates a ticket for chunk loading every time it moves into a new chunk, and also periodically every 10 seconds. It loads and ticks the chunk it is in with a ticket level of 31 as entity processing. It also loads a two-chunk wide ring (a 5×5 chunk area centered on the pearl's chunk) around it as lazy chunks, the first ring being block ticking and the second ring being border chunks. The ender pearl continues to load chunks as long as the player who threw it is online, even when that player is in a different dimension. The pearl stops loading chunks when the player logs off, and starts loading chunks again when the player logs in.
Spawning endermites[edit | edit source]
An ender pearl has a 5% chance to spawn an endermite when it lands. This is the only way through which endermites can spawn, without using cheats. The endermite spawns at the player's position when the pearl lands‌[Java Edition only], or at the pearl's landing site‌[Bedrock Edition only].

Issues[edit | edit source]
Issues relating to ""Ender Pearl"" are maintained on the bug tracker. Issues should be reported and viewed there.
Trivia[edit | edit source]
Ender pearls can be used to teleport/move through non-solid blocks without suffocation and solid blocks by pressing against the blocks and using the ender pearl at the player's feet until the player goes through.[9][10]
In Java Edition, it is possible to spawn a thrown ender pearl using commands, but it does not teleport, unless it is assigned an owner.
If the player throws an ender pearl in Survival mode and changes to Creative mode before the pearl lands, the player is still teleported.
The player is still teleported by throwing an ender pearl and entering the Nether before it lands. The pearl is not lost if an ender pearl is thrown into a nether portal and the player travels through the portal; the pearl lands and teleports the player as usual.
If multiple ender pearls are thrown in succession, the player can be hurt only once from fall damage within about a one-second span.

↑ The types of map sold by a villager depend on the biome it spawned it. More information in Trading.
If the cartographer is in the Nether or the End, either spawned or transported, the trades for the map do not unlock. If the world does not generate a particular structure, trades for the map for that structure also do not unlock.
In Java Edition, each cartographer sells its own unique explorer map that points to a different location than other cartographers. Purchasing another explorer map from the same cartographer results in the same explorer map. In Bedrock Edition, a cartographer sells explorer maps that point to the nearest unexplored location, regardless of whether it has been previously mapped by another cartographer. After a player explores the location, the cartographer sells a new map. Structures are counted as explored when the player loads the chunks that the structure is in, even if the player never entered the structure.
In Bedrock Edition, if cartographer map trades are unlocked in an old world, the game stops ticking.
Generated loot[edit | edit source]
In contrast to explorer maps, buried treasure maps (Java Edition) or treasure maps (Bedrock Edition) generate in ocean ruins or in shipwrecks.

Locating structures[edit | edit source]
There are 4 types of explorer maps: ocean, woodland, trial, and buried treasure. These maps differ from a normal map, in that it shows the area's land-water outline, with an orange striated (striped) texture for water[1], and the blank map texture for land. The maps show a section of land that contains an ocean monument, woodland mansion, trial chambers, or buried treasure respectively.
If the ""Villager Trade Rebalance"" experiment is enabled, there are 7 additional explorer maps: jungle explorer maps that show a jungle pyramid, swamp explorer maps that show a swamp hut, as well as maps for desert, plains, savanna, snowy and taiga villages.
The structure shown may not be the nearest such structure to the player. The structures are displayed as a small icon. If the player icon is smaller than it would be on a normal map, that means the player is a great distance away. When the player is less than 1027 blocks away from the map border, the icon returns to the proper size. When the player reaches the map's area of land (512×512), the map fills in like a normal map.
The basic functions of a buried treasure explorer map are similar to that of the others. However, instead of showing the structure icon on the map, it shows a red X instead. The buried treasure chest is located on the same X and Z coordinates as the middle of the X (the player marker may need to be aligned with the bottom of the middle 2×2 pixel square of the X). To locate the chest spot, hold the treasure map with both hands, not in the offhand slot.

The parts of the world that have already been explored and mapped are copied, and newly explored areas appear on both instances. In Creative mode, cloned explorer maps can be obtained by pick blocking on the explorer map displayed on item frames (the map needs to be out of the player's inventory when using pick block, or else that map moves into the active hotbar slot).

Explorer maps fill as the chunks are generated, rather than when the player holds them while in the area; leaving an explorer map while exploring the area still fills the map.
In Bedrock Edition, inventory editors and add-ons can be used to create Explorer Maps that lead to any structure.

Usage[edit | edit source]
Locating strongholds[edit | edit source]
An animation of an eye of ender shattering.
To locate strongholds (and the end portals they house):
Pressing use while holding an eye of ender causes it to fly approximately 12 blocks in the direction of the nearest stronghold, traveling through any blocks necessary, and leave a trail of purple particles, the same particle effect used for endermen and ender chests.
The eye leads to the chunk where a spiral staircase, the first room generated in the stronghold, is located.
The center of this entrance staircase is always exactly at the chunk coordinates 4, ~, 4, although the eye of ender leads to chunk coordinates 0, ~, 0 (the northwest corner of the chunk).
While over 12 blocks away from the northwest corner of the staircase chunk, the eye travels upward to offer an easily-visible indication of the horizontal direction the player must travel.
When closer than 12 blocks to the northwest corner of the staircase chunk, the eye travels downward, to indicate the player is above a stronghold and must mine downward.
After two or three seconds of travel, the eye floats in the air briefly, then either falls (becoming collectable again) or shatters in mid-air. The eye has a 20% chance of shattering (80% chance of surviving) per throw. Therefore, throwing it three times has approximately a 50% overall chance to shatter the eye (0.83=51.2%).
The eye of ender's flying function works only in the Overworld and only if a stronghold exists or can generate in the world. It does nothing in the Nether, the End, or custom dimensions, unless a structure able to generate in that dimension has been added to the #minecraft:eye_of_ender_located structure tag.
Note that the eyes may point to an incorrect location if the target chunks were generated with a different biomes map in an older version or through different generation settings.[1]
Activating end portals[edit | edit source]
An end portal activated with eyes of ender.
Once an end portal is found, eyes of ender are required to activate it. End portals require a total of 12 eyes of ender in order to activate, though each individual frame-block has a 10% chance of containing an eye of ender when generated. Eyes can be placed in empty end portal frames by pressing use on them until the entire ring of 12 is filled, thereby activating the portal. Because there is a 10% chance of for each individual end portal frame to contain an eye, there is a 1 in 1 trillion chance that every frame will have an eye in it, thereby activating the portal automatically.

Exactly 28% 38% 23% 9% 2% <1%

History[edit | edit source]
[hide]
Java Edition
1.0.0 Beta 1.9 Prerelease 3 Added eyes of ender.
Eyes of ender can be used on a portal block to repair them, but repairing them does nothing.
Beta 1.9 Prerelease 4 Each eye can now be placed in a portal block or used to hone in on a stronghold. Jeb demonstrated the new uses for an eye in his livestream.[2] An end portal within a stronghold could be seen in the stream with two eyes inserted into blocks.
In older worlds with chunks generated before Beta 1.9 Prerelease 3, the eyes may mislead the player to a place where there isn't a stronghold at all. This happens because the eyes lead to where a stronghold should be based on the world seed in the current version, but before Beta 1.9 Prerelease 3 strongholds generated differently based on the seed. Therefore, if the player saved the coordinates the eye traveled to in an old world and generated a new world with the same seed, the player could travel to those same coordinates and find a stronghold.
Beta 1.9 Prerelease 6 Eyes of ender no longer render like a tool in third person.
RC1 The throwing sound of eyes of ender has been changed.
1.3.1 12w21a Eyes of ender can now be used to craft ender chests.
Priest villagers would buy 2–3 eyes of ender for one emerald.
12w22a Priest villagers no longer buy eyes of ender, instead sell them for 7–10 emeralds.
1.6.4 1.6.3 Eyes of ender now lead to strongholds based on the structure data saved in the world file instead of calculating their approximate location via the world seed. Therefore, strongholds generated in old versions can still be found even if the distribution of strongholds is changed.
1.7.2 13w41a Eyes of ender now lead to the entrance of a stronghold instead of the portal room.
1.8 14w02a With changes that have been made to villagers and the trading system, cleric villagers now sell eyes of ender for 7–11 emeralds, as one of their tier III trades.
14w06a Eyes of ender now spawn at the player's feet when thrown instead of their eyes.[3]
1.9 15w41a Eyes of ender are no longer sold by cleric villagers.
15w44b An eye of ender is now used to craft an end crystal.
16w07a Eyes of ender now spawn at the player's chest when thrown instead of their feet.
pre3 Eyes of ender now point to the 125 new strongholds.[4]
1.11 16w35a Throwing an eye of ender now slows down the player for the time that the use button is held down, similar to eating, drinking etc..[5] This was done to prevent it from also causing the item in the offhand to be used.[6]
1.12 17w17a A new pop sound has been added when a thrown eye of ender bursts.
1.14 18w43a The texture of eyes of ender has been changed.
18w50a Now have an optional Item tag that can specify a different item stack to render.
1.19 22w11a Eyes of ender now lead to the corner of the chunk (0, ~, 0) instead of the center (8, ~, 8).[7]

Trivia[edit | edit source]
When thrown in third-person view, the eyes of ender fly out from the player's chest instead of their hand.
In Bedrock Edition the eye of ender flies out of the top right of the screen above the player head.
In Bedrock Edition if the player travels beyond a certain radius (roughly 740,000 blocks), eyes of ender always point to a stronghold near spawn, even though strongholds continue to generate past this limit. If one travels to this limit, they can see eyes of ender suddenly switching direction. A similar phenomenon occurs with the /locate command.

Obtaining[edit | edit source]
Firework rockets can be obtained by crafting.
In Java Edition, firework rockets with no explosive effects and 3 different flight durations are available in the Creative inventory. In Bedrock Edition, 16 firework rockets with the different base colors and the ""small ball"" effect, and a single firework with no explosion are available in the Creative inventory; these all have a flight duration of 1.
By crafting the rocket using firework star(s), colors, trail, and explosion effects can be added to the fireworks.
Crafting[edit | edit source]
Ingredients Crafting recipe
[hide]
Description
Paper +
Gunpowder

3

When crafted without a firework star, the rocket does not have explosion effects. The amount of gunpowder used increases the flight duration to a maximum of three.
Any Firework Star +
Paper +
Gunpowder

3

Up to three gunpowder can be used, which increases flight duration. Any remaining spaces can be filled with firework stars to combine various effects. All firework stars explode almost simultaneously when the rocket detonates.
Usage[edit | edit source]
Launching fireworks[edit | edit source]
A firework rocket can be launched up vertically by using its item on a block. Firework rockets can also be launched from dispensers and crossbows.
Dispenser[edit | edit source]
Using firework rockets with a dispenser is different than launching it on a block. The direction the dispenser is facing launches the firework in that direction; for example, if the dispenser is facing downward, the firework goes downward instead of going up.
Crossbow[edit | edit source]
A firework rocket can be used as ammunition for crossbows, although it deals damage only if it has an explosion effect. A higher flight duration gives the firework rocket a longer range, and more damage is added per firework star. If shot from a Multishot crossbow, then 3 rockets fire with the same effects. The Piercing enchantment has no effect on firework rockets shot from a crossbow.
In Java Edition, if a firework rocket shot from a crossbow hits an entity, the rocket instantly explodes, no matter the flight duration. Attempting to do this in Bedrock Edition, however, results in the firework passing through the entity,[1] so the player must plan where to aim.
Boosting elytra[edit | edit source]
Normally, elytra can glide for a short distance, but with the use of fireworks, the player can fly a long distance, gain speed, and take off from the ground. Using a firework rocket while flying with elytra propels the player in the direction they are facing. If the rocket is equipped with a firework star of any kind, the player takes damage when it explodes.
The duration of the speed boost depends on the flight duration of the rocket - a higher flight duration means a longer boost.
Elytra flight boost duration per level of firework (somewhat random)
Firework flight duration Elytra flight boost duration
1 ~1.17 seconds
2 ~1.48 seconds
3 ~2.22 seconds
Village raids[edit | edit source]
After successfully defending a village from a raid, the villagers may celebrate by setting off firework rockets.
Behavior[edit | edit source]
See also: Firework Star § Effects
Once launched, fireworks fly out vertically, with random horizontal offset up to 5 blocks. Fireworks can fly in any of the 6 directions a dispenser can point. After some time, the firework explodes into a colorful explosion based on the effects of the firework stars added upon crafting, or no explosion if no firework star was used. If multiple firework stars were added to the rocket upon crafting, they all explode simultaneously.
The explosion of a firework rocket deals damage to mobs and players that are within 5 blocks and not obstructed by solid blocks. The maximum damage of a rocket with one firework star is 7HP, with the damage decreasing with distance. Each additional firework star on the rocket adds 2HP points of damage, for a maximum damage of 19HP × 9.5 with 7 stars. Using commands to add additional firework stars results in more damage. The damage dealt is unaffected by any other ingredients used. The explosion does not destroy end crystals, item frames, or paintings, but does destroy armor stands and decorative pots.
There is a delay between the detonation and the player hearing the sound, emulating real fireworks, but this sound travels much more slowly than in the real world.[2][3] In Java Edition, the explosion of a firework can be seen 64 blocks away, regardless of its height. In Bedrock Edition, the explosion can be seen from the player's render distance.
If the explosion exceeds the particle limit of 16,384, the oldest particles are removed before displaying new ones, resulting in severely diminished firework quality / duration. At most a firework should have 3 trail stars, more than that could waste diamonds, firework stars, and other fireworks. Particle counts per star are:
Ball type Plain Trail
Small 98 ~1300
Large 387 4000+
Star 122 ~1600
Creeper 266 ~3500
Burst 72 ~930
Twinkle effect adds 2 particles to the count.
Like most other entities, fireworks can be moved by water and explosions, and teleported via portals. They also cannot move through solid surfaced blocks: upon hitting one, they either move to a side or explode based on the duration. If a firework explodes under a block, its explosion is flattened.
Non-lethal fireworks and fireworks crafted with firework stars behave differently around terrains. Lethal fireworks when shot at a solid block explode immediately upon impact, while non-lethal fireworks glide on whatever surface they encounter along their paths for the remainder of their duration and may resume their original trajectories upon exiting the surface.
Duration and direction[edit | edit source]
Fireworks travel different heights based on the amount of gunpowder added. The number is displayed as a tag on the item's tooltip with the description of ""Flight Duration"".
Each firework determines its lifetime in ticks by 10 × (number of gunpowder + 1) + random value from 0 to 5 + random value from 0 to 6, after which it explodes.
When spawned by player or command, the height it rises is between 8 and 20 blocks with 1 gunpowder, 18 to 34 blocks with 2 gunpowder, and 32 to 52 blocks with 3 gunpowder. (Note: In Java Edition, it is possible to use commands to create firework rockets with higher durations. These rockets go higher and keep accelerating with virtually no terminal velocity. If the duration is long enough, the firework rocket could reach heights of over 1,000,000 blocks and speeds of over 10,000 m/s in a matter of minutes. Such fireworks with significant X and Z motions speed up sideways exponentially and reach outside the world boundary in a matter of seconds.)
When spawned, fireworks have a vertical speed of .05 and a random small X and Z speed (random value near zero with a standard deviation of .001). Each tick, the firework accelerates horizontally by multiplying its X and Z velocities by 1.15, and vertically by adding a constant factor of 0.04.
When shot from a dispenser, it travels 9 to 10 blocks with 1 gunpowder, 14 to 15 blocks with 2 gunpowder, and 19 to 20 blocks with 3 gunpowder in the direction it was dispensed. When dispensed, the firework has a random velocity close to 0.5 (with a maximum deviation of .009) in the direction it was dispensed and a random small velocity in both other directions (random value near zero with a maximum deviation of .009). The firework's velocity does not change over the lifetime of the rocket.
Fireworks can be made to travel different directions by being dispensed or launched under flowing water. The firework's direction combines with the flow of the water to go diagonally. The direction changes significantly less if the firework is shot by a dispenser instead of by hand.

Launching a rocket by hand on a wooden pressure plate activates it. The same doesn't hold for stone pressure plates, or for a dispenser placing a rocket onto a wooden pressure plate.
New Year's Eve is what inspired Jeb to add fireworks.[6]
If the player shoots a firework into a Nether portal, it explodes in the Nether.
There are around 2×10136 distinct fireworks.
When a firework crafted without a firework star touches the surface of a block, it emits footstep noises.

Mob loot[edit | edit source]
In Java Edition, drowned have a 3.75% chance of spawning with a fishing rod equipped. In Bedrock Edition, a naturally spawned drowned has a 0.85% chance to spawn with a fishing rod, while a converted drowned has a 1% chance to spawn with it. If killed, they have an 8.5% chance of dropping this fishing rod. That chance increases by 1% for each level of Looting applied to a weapon (up to 11.5% chance). The dropped item is damaged and never enchanted.

Carrot/warped fungus on a stick[edit | edit source]
If a carrot on a stick or a warped fungus on a stick is used to the point of zero durability, it becomes a fishing rod again.
Usage[edit | edit source]
Fishing[edit | edit source]
Main article: Fishing
Fishing rods can be cast into water. After a short period of time, a stream of bubble particles approaches the fishing rod. If the rod is reeled in once the particles ""bite"" the bobber, the player obtains a fish, junk, or possibly a treasure item. If the fishing rod was in the player's hand and is no longer, the fishing bobber entity despawns, unless the fishing rod to the off-hand or it has been swapped with another fishing rod.[citation needed]

Description
Carrot on a Stick Fishing Rod or
Damaged Fishing Rod +
Carrot

The fishing rod must be diagonally above the carrot to craft the carrot on a stick.
Warped Fungus on a Stick Fishing Rod or
Damaged Fishing Rod +
Warped Fungus

Crafting from a damaged fishing rod is available only in Bedrock Edition. Java Edition requires an unused fishing rod.
Hooking mobs and other entities[edit | edit source]
See also: Fishing § Fishing rod durability
The fishing rod can be used to hook mobs, items‌[Java Edition only] and some entities, including players. The fishing rod can then be reeled in, dragging the hooked object toward the player without dealing damage. Reeling in a mob or entity costs 5 points of durability, and reeling in an item costs 3 points. Reeling a mob pulls it toward the player with a speed of 1⁄10 the distance between mob and player. Hooking entities in Bedrock Edition with a flaming bobber cast through fire or lava can ignite the entity.
The maximum distance the player can get between the bobber and themselves is 33 blocks. A hooked entity that exceeds this distance detaches from the bobber.
Multiple players can hook the same entity, and when multiple players reel in the entity at the same time, it flies a larger distance than normal.
Besides mobs and items, entities that can be reeled in include:
Boats
Boat with Chests
Minecarts of any type
Armor Stands
Shulker Bullets
Fireballs
Primed TNT
Any falling block such as:
Sand
Gravel
Dragon Eggs
Concrete Powder
Scaffolding
Snow ‌[Bedrock Edition only]
Anvils
Some entities can be hooked, but cannot be reeled in:
Mobs riding/being ridden by other mobs (in Bedrock Edition, the hooked mob dismounts)
Paintings
Item Frames ‌[Java Edition only]
Lead knots
End Crystals
Shulkers
Attempting to reel in said entities still costs durability to the rod.
Any other entities cannot be hooked at all.
Fuel[edit | edit source]
A fishing rod can be used as fuel in furnaces, smelting 1.5 items per fishing rod, regardless of its durability.
Other usage[edit | edit source]
The hook can also be used to activate wooden pressure plates or weighted pressure plates.

Mining[edit | edit source]
When a block of gravel is mined, there is a 10% chance for a single piece of flint to drop instead of the gravel block. When mined with a Fortune-enchanted tool, this chance increases to 16% at Fortune I, 25% at Fortune II, and 100% at Fortune III. Gravel mined using a tool with Silk Touch or gravel that fell on a non-solid block never produces flint.

Usage[edit | edit source]
Igniting[edit | edit source]
When used on the space above any solid top surface, on any side of any flammable block or any side of any obsidian block within a valid unlit nether portal frame regardless of if there is a solid top surface available, the flint and steel places a fire there.
Flint and steel can be used to light unlit campfires, candles and cakes with candles.
Flint and steel can be used to light nether portals, as any fire existing within an appropriate obsidian frame is instantly replaced with nether portal blocks that occupy the entirety of the frame. Flint and steel cannot light end portals.
Using flint and steel on TNT ignites it. The explosion damage dealt by TNT ignited with flint and steel in this specific way counts as the player's attack. If the player is sneaking, a fire is instead placed on the side of the TNT the flint and steel was used on.
A flint and steel can be used on a creeper or charged creeper to force it to explode. Explosions initiated in this way cannot be cancelled.
When powered, a dispenser containing flint and steel can place fires or ignite relevant blocks such as TNT or campfires in the space directly in front of it. This reduces the flint and steel's durability. A dispenser containing a flint and steel cannot detonate creepers.

Trivia[edit | edit source]
In Adventure mode, flint and steel cannot light fires, nor can it ignite nether portals (unless it has the tag CanPlaceOn:obsidian). However, it can still ignite TNT and creepers.
Mojang mentioned steel as a ""stronger"" iron, but there are no plans to add it to the game.
In the April Fools snapshot Java Edition 23w13a or b, one of the possible votes was “Flint and Steel can ignite any block”.

Food,"For food in Minecraft Dungeons, see MCD:Food.
A player eating a cooked porkchop in Bedrock Edition (third-person front view).
A player eating bread in Java Edition (first-person view).
Food refers to any consumable items that, when eaten, restore hunger points and hunger saturation points, and sometimes cause status effects. They are essential for survival, as going without them eventually causes the player to starve, causing damage until reaching 10HP on Easy, 1HP on Normal, or until the player dies on Hard difficulty.
Food is eaten by holding use while having the food item selected in the hot bar or in the off-hand. Eating (or drinking) a consumable takes approximately 1.6 seconds, with the exception of dried kelp, which takes half of the time. Only cake cannot be eaten this way, and must instead be placed on a surface before being eaten.
With the exception of chorus fruit, golden apples, enchanted golden apples, honey bottles, and suspicious stew, food cannot be eaten when the hunger bar is completely full. In Creative mode, any food can be consumed at any time.
All food items and ingredients can be stacked in the inventory slots, except for rabbit stew, mushroom stew, beetroot soup, suspicious stew, and cake.‌[Java Edition only]
This page covers food items for players. Blocks and items that can be eaten by other mobs, such as wolves are covered on their respective pages.

Hunger and saturation[edit | edit source]
Main article: Hunger § Mechanics
See also: Tutorial:Hunger management
Raw (left) and cooked (right) chicken. Eating raw chicken can give the player food poisoning.
Players have two different food statistics, one of which is visible: The hunger level is visible, and the saturation level is not.
Saturation is the first statistic to decrease when a player performs energy-intensive actions, and it must be completely depleted before the visible hunger meter begins decreasing. Although the current saturation level is generally hidden, the player can tell that their saturation level is completely depleted if the visible hunger meter begins displaying a jittering effect.
Eating a food item replenishes a fixed number of hunger points and saturation points, based on the item. Some foods have a better ratio of saturation to hunger points replenished than others. Overeating the hunger bar does not overflow to saturation.
A player's current saturation level can never exceed their current hunger level. A player at a hunger level of 5, for example, can be at a maximum of 5 saturation. Food always restores hunger (raising the saturation limit) before supplying saturation. The most efficient use of food is to eat low-saturation food to fill the hunger bar, followed by high-saturation food to fill saturation. While a few hunger points may be wasted when eating nourishing food when nearly full, eating nourishing foods on a low hunger bar wastes even more points of saturation. Maximizing saturation increases the length of time (and/or the amount of damage healed) before the player needs to eat again.
Usage[edit | edit source]
Any food, except cake, can be eaten by hand, by using the food item in the main hand. It takes 1.61 seconds to eat most foods by hand. Although, dried kelp only takes 0.865 seconds to eat by hand. A player can hold food in their offhand in Java Edition, and use.
Eating food by hand causes food particles to spew from the player's mouth, and produces a munching noise. The particles correlate with the respective food item. Eating also slows the user significantly.
Cake has to be eaten by placing it, then right-clicking on its block form. Eating a slice of cake is instant, and each cake has 7 edible slices. The cake becomes thinner as each slice is removed.
Nourishment value[edit | edit source]
Nourishment is defined as the ratio of saturation to hunger points restored. Foods with higher nourishment values should be eaten when the hunger bar is more full.
The nourishment table below can help by categorizing foods by their saturation-to-hunger restoration ratios. See the more detailed Foods table for the exact hunger and saturation statistics of each food.

↑ Food Points + Saturation, which gives roughly how long the food can last. See hunger for details. This value is reduced if the player is near the food or saturation cap, as excess points of either type are wasted.
↑
a b c Average expected food quality if food poisoning isn't cured. Food poisoning lasts 30 seconds from the last food that inflicted it, and drains nearly 2 shanks of hunger over that duration. The loss comes from saturation before visible hunger.
↑ Food quality if poison isn't cured; healing the damage from poison quickly drains the hunger bar.

Drinking[edit | edit source]
Drinking a potion or honey bottle returns the empty glass bottle. Throwing a splash potion or a lingering potion does not return a glass bottle, but brewing a lingering potion gives back a glass bottle.
Mud[edit | edit source]
Using a water bottle, splash water bottle or lingering water bottle on dirt, coarse dirt, or rooted dirt transform it into a mud block, at the same time leaving the player with an empty glass bottle.
Cauldrons[edit | edit source]
Using a water bottle (or, in Bedrock Edition, a potion, splash potion, or lingering potion) on a cauldron that is not yet full adds that liquid to the cauldron, leaving the player with an empty glass bottle.
Usage[edit | edit source]
Glass bottles can be filled to make water bottles, which can then be used to brew items with a brewing stand. Glass bottles are also used to hold the resulting potion.
Collecting liquids[edit | edit source]
Water[edit | edit source]
A bottle may be filled with water by holding it in the hand and using it on a water source block or a cauldron that has water in it. It can also be filled using a waterlogged block.‌[Java Edition only][1]
Also, a bottle may be filled by powering a dispenser containing a bottle and pointed at a water source block. This does not work with cauldrons.[2]
If filled via a water source, the water is unaffected. If filled via a cauldron, 1⁄3 of the water in the cauldron is removed. Therefore, using a cauldron to fill water bottles is inefficient, except in the Nether where it is normally the only way to fill bottles.
Potion[edit | edit source]
In Bedrock Edition, a bottle may be filled with potion by using it on a cauldron containing potion. When the bottle is filled, 1⁄3 of the cauldron's potion is removed.
Honey[edit | edit source]
If a bee nest or beehive is full, the player can use a glass bottle on the block, or may power a dispenser that contains a bottle and is pointed at the block, which empties the block and creates a honey bottle. Honey bottles can also be emptied by using them in crafting recipes (such as sugar or honey block). However, a lingering potion use on tipped arrow recipe does not give the bottle back.
Dragon's breath[edit | edit source]
Using a glass bottle in clouds emitted when the ender dragon breathes or shoots a dragon fireball fills the bottle with dragon's breath.
When put 2 or more dragon's breath in the brewing stand, after the brewing process, a glass bottle drops as an entity. However, if put only 1 dragon's breath in the brewing stand, after the brewing process, the glass bottle is consumed and cannot be retrieved.[3]

Post-generation[edit | edit source]
A bunch (item) of glow berries can be collected from cave vines by using or breaking the vine. This yields one bunch of glow berries when the vine is bearing them and nothing when it is not. A cave vine also breaks if water runs over its location or if a piston extends or pushes a block into its location.
Fortune has no effect on the number of glow berries dropped.
Usage[edit | edit source]
Placement[edit | edit source]
Glow berries can be placed on and grown from the bottom of most blocks (any block whose bottom face covers the bottom of the entire block). They can also be placed on the bottom of a cave vine, extending the stack of vines by 1 block. They have no specific lighting requirements.
Growth[edit | edit source]
Placing glow berries on the bottom of a block creates a cave vine that grows downward one block at a time as long as air is beneath it and its maximum height (2 to 26 blocks) has not been reached.
Farming[edit | edit source]
Cave vines are functionally a crop, and glow berries are its seeds. However, it grows differently than farmland crops do. In Bedrock Edition, cave vines is technically an item on its own. In Java Edition there is no proper cave vines item, and glow berries is the closest thing to its item form.
Each newly-grown cave vine block has an 11% chance of bearing glow berries. Glow berries only grow on a newly produced cave vine, and only when it first grows. A cave vine bearing no berry does not naturally grow a berry, unlike sweet berry bushes ‌[Java Edition only][more information needed].
Using bone meal on a cave vine produces a glow berry in the vine, if the vine was not bearing glow berries.
Cave vines stop growing if shears are used on the bottom block of the stack.
In Bedrock Edition, in the Nether, cave vines can grow and bear glow berries.
The different types of cave vines actually have different block names and ids. Futhermore, there are 3 different item versions of the cave vines blocks in Bedrock Edition.
Food[edit | edit source]
To eat glow berries, press and hold use while it is selected in the hotbar. Eating one restores 2 () hunger and 0.4‌[JE only] / 1.2‌[BE only] hunger saturation, like sweet berries.
Light[edit | edit source]
When bearing glow berries, cave vines give off a light level of 14.
Composting[edit | edit source]
Placing glow berries into a composter by using them on it has a 30% chance of raising the compost level by 1.
Breeding[edit | edit source]
Glow berries can be fed to foxes to breed them.
Glow berries can be used on baby foxes to reduce the time until they grow by 10%.

Glow ink sacs can be used on signs or hanging signs to make their text brighter in low light levels. This also adds an outline around the text on the sign, the color of which is based on the color of the sign's text. The text does not emit any light, it is only more visible in darkness, similarly to the eyes of spiders and endermen. Normal ink sacs can be applied to revert glowing text back to default.

Item data[edit | edit source]
Java Edition:
See also: Data component format
[NBT Compound / JSON Object] components: the item's components tag.
[NBT Compound / JSON Object] minecraft:entity_data: NBT applied to an entity when created from an item.
See Entity format. Must include id tag. Unlike spawn eggs, cannot change the type of entity created using the id tag. Data that item frames do not normally use (see below) has no effect.
Entity data[edit | edit source]
Main article: Entity format
In Java Edition, glow item frames have entity data that define various properties of the entity.
[NBT Compound / JSON Object] Entity data
Tags common to all entities[show]
Tags common to all block entities that can hang from blocks[show]
[Boolean] Fixed: 1 or 0 (true/false) - If true: the item frame does not drop when it has no support block, it can not be moved by pistons, and it won't take damage (except from creative players). An item cannot be placed in or removed from a fixed item frame. The item in a fixed item frame (if any) can not be rotated.
[Boolean] Invisible: 1 or 0 (true/false) - Whether the item frame (background) is invisible. An item or map inside an invisible item frame is still visible.
[NBT Compound / JSON Object] Item: The item in the item frame (no slot tag). If the item frame is empty, this tag does not exist.
Tags common to all items[show]
[Float] ItemDropChance: The chance for the item to drop when the item frame breaks. This is a 100% chance by default.
[Byte] ItemRotation: The current angle or rotation of the item, as a multiple of 45 degrees, going clockwise. 0 means the item is upright, 1 means the item is turned 45 degrees clockwise from the upright orientation. This value can only ever be between 0 and 7, just like its redstone output when measured with a comparator.
Block data[edit | edit source]
In Bedrock Edition, a glow item frame has a block entity associated with it that holds additional data about the block.
See Bedrock Edition level format/Block entity format.

Usage[edit | edit source]
While equipped, players can use glow sticks to shake them, causing them to appear bright regardless of the light level. This is only an aesthetic change, as no light is emitted to the surrounding area. A particle effect is visible until the durability runs out. The glow stick's durability depletes while lit, in both Survival and Creative modes.

Obtaining[edit | edit source]
Mob loot[edit | edit source]
A horn is dropped when an adult goat rams a tree or any other hard block that occurs naturally where goats spawn. These include stone, coal ore, copper ore, iron ore, emerald ore, log, or packed ice. Goats do not ram other solid blocks. In Java Edition, these blocks are listed under the snaps_goat_horn tag, and can be modified by data packs.
Up to two horns can be dropped from an adult goat, or one horn if the goat spawned with only one horn. Regular goats may drop the ""Ponder"", ""Sing"", ""Seek"", and ""Feel"" horns, while screaming goats drop the ""Admire"", ""Call"", ""Yearn"", and ""Dream"" horns. A specific goat drops only one type of horn; that is, if a goat drops a ""Sing"" horn, its other horn is also a ""Sing"" horn.

Usage[edit | edit source]
When used, they play a loud sound that can be heard from up to 256 blocks, but are also limited by the server view distance. Each horn variant plays a unique sound. There are eight variants, four of which are exclusive to screaming goats.
There is a cooldown of seven seconds between each use of the horn. All goat horns are affected by this cooldown.

Crafting ingredient[edit | edit source]
As a material for weapons, tools, and armor, gold is not a straight upgrade from iron (except in the case of horse armor). Gold has a higher mining speed and enchantability than any other material, but low attack power and durability.

Mining[edit | edit source]
Nether gold ore mined using a pickaxe drops 2-6 gold nuggets. If the pickaxe is enchanted with Fortune, it has a 33.3% chance to multiply the drops by 2, Fortune II has a 25% chance to multiply the drops by 2 or 3 and Fortune III has a 20% chance each to multiply the drops by 2, 3, or 4 for a maximum possible drop of 24 golden nuggets. The average drop rate for a Fortune III pickaxe is 8.8, while the drop rate for a Silk Touch pickaxe is a single ingot, or a flat rate of 9. It is slightly more efficient to mine with a Silk Touch pickaxe.
Gilded blackstone mined using a pickaxe has a 10% chance to drop 2-5 gold nuggets. If the pickaxe is enchanted with Fortune I, the chance gold nuggets drop is increased 14.29%, Fortune II increases the drop chance to 25%, and Fortune III guarantees the drop.
Usage[edit | edit source]
Gold nuggets can be used to craft a golden carrot or glistering melon for brewing. Also, gold nuggets can be combined with gunpowder and dye to create a firework star that bursts in a star-shaped explosion.
Piglins instantly pick up any gold nuggets that are within 1 block of them. Unlike other gold-related items, they do not intentionally seek out gold nuggets to pick up and only pick them up if they walk near it. Unlike gold ingots, gold nuggets picked up are dropped upon the piglin's death.

Mob loot[edit | edit source]
Equipment[edit | edit source]
Main article: Drops § Equipped items
A piglin brute spawns with a golden axe and has an 8.5% chance (9.5% with Looting I, 10.5% with Looting II, and 11.5% with Looting III) of dropping it upon death by the player. Also, in Java Edition, zombified piglins can drop their golden axe (with the same chance as piglin brute drop) if they have been zombified from a piglin brute.
Villager gifts[edit | edit source]
Weaponsmith villagers occasionally throw golden axes at players with the Hero of the Village status effect.‌[Java Edition only]
Usage[edit | edit source]
Breaking[edit | edit source]
Golden axes can break wood-related blocks faster than other tools. Breaking a block costs 1 durability.[note 1]
↑ Blocks that break instantly don't use up durability.
Stripping[edit | edit source]
Using a golden axe on a log, wood block, or block of bamboo turns it into a stripped log, stripped wood, or block of stripped bamboo, respectively. This costs 1 point of durability of the axe.
Copper blocks[edit | edit source]
Using a golden axe on a waxed or oxidized copper block removes the wax if it has any, or otherwise remove a level of oxidization. This costs 1 point of durability.
Weapon[edit | edit source]
When used as a weapon, a golden axe loses 2 durability points.
Java Edition[edit | edit source]
Attacking a shield user with an axe disables the use of the shield for 5 seconds. Vindicators, piglin brutes, or other mobs with commands always disable the player's shield. Damage done when using an axe as a weapon is more than that of a sword of the same tier, though they take longer than a sword to recover, resulting in lower DPS.
Attack damage Attack speed Recovery time DPS Lifetime damage inflicted[note 1]
7HP 1.0 1 second (20 game ticks) 7.0 112HP × 56
↑ The formula to find the total lifetime damage is ceil(durability ÷ 2) × damage per hit. The durability is halved then ceiled because axes take double durability when used as a weapon, and the last 1 durability can also deal damage. The formula also ignores enchantments and critical hits, and assumes each attack is performed at maximum charge.
Bedrock Edition[edit | edit source]
Golden axes attack instantly with no cooldown and deal 4HP damage, but they lower the durability of armor and shields faster than a sword would do.

Mob loot[edit | edit source]
Zombies, husks, skeletons, strays, bogged, piglins, and zombified piglins have a small chance to spawn wearing armor. There is a 8.5% chance (9.5% with Looting I, 10.5% with Looting II and 11.5% with Looting III) for the mob to drop the boots they're wearing upon death unless they are spawned from an ominous trial spawner. The dropped boots are usually badly damaged, and may be enchanted with enchantment levels 5-19.
Usage[edit | edit source]
When worn, golden boots provide 1 () armor point.
Piglins[edit | edit source]
As with other pieces of gold armor, piglins do not attack players wearing golden boots unless provoked or attacked.
Piglins are also attracted towards golden boots on the ground and equip them after inspecting them.

Armor trimming[edit | edit source]
It is possible to upgrade armor with trims. This requires a smithing template, boots, and an ingot or crystal (iron ingot, copper ingot, gold ingot, netherite ingot, emerald, redstone dust, lapis lazuli, amethyst shard, nether quartz, diamond, or resin brick).
These trims have no effect on the gameplay or strength of the armor.

Mob loot[edit | edit source]
Zombies, husks, skeletons, strays, bogged and piglins have a small chance to spawn wearing armor. There is a 8.5% chance (9.5% with Looting I, 10.5% with Looting II and 11.5% with Looting III) for the mob to drop the chestplate they're wearing upon death unless they are spawned from an ominous trial spawner. The dropped chestplate is usually badly damaged, and may be enchanted with enchantment levels 5-19.
Usage[edit | edit source]
When worn, a golden chestplate provides 5 () armor points.
Piglins[edit | edit source]
As with other pieces of gold armor, piglins do not attack players wearing golden chestplates unless provoked or attacked.
Piglins are also attracted towards golden chestplates on the ground and equip them after inspecting them.

Armor trimming[edit | edit source]
It is possible to upgrade armor with trims. This requires a smithing template, a chestplate, and an ingot or crystal (iron ingot, copper ingot, gold ingot, netherite ingot, emerald, redstone dust, lapis lazuli, amethyst shard, nether quartz, diamond, or resin brick).

Usage[edit | edit source]
Main article: Hoe § Usage
Harvesting[edit | edit source]
Hoes are used to harvest certain plant-based or organic blocks more quickly. Breaking one of these blocks takes 1 durability.
Breaking any other block takes 0 durability if the block breaks instantly when broken by hand, or 1 otherwise.
Tilling[edit | edit source]
Hoes are used to turn dirt, grass blocks, and dirt paths into farmland. To till, press use on a grass or dirt block while holding a hoe. This does not work on mycelium or podzol,[1] nor does it work if there are other blocks on top of the targeted blocks, including snow layers or torches. However, mycelium and podzol can be first converted to dirt paths with a shovel, then tilled into farmland with a hoe.
Hoes can be used to convert coarse dirt into regular dirt by pressing use on the coarse dirt. Similar to tilling dirt, the space above the coarse dirt must be empty for it to be tilled.
Hoes can also be used on rooted dirt, which turns it into normal dirt, and yields a hanging roots item.
Tilling is effectively instantaneous, regardless of material, and uses 1 durability. Breaking blocks with a hoe uses 0 or 1 durability, depending on the block.
Hoes are unable to work on blocks with a plant on top, even if that plant could normally be placed on top of farmland without reverting it to dirt.[2]
Weapon[edit | edit source]
Hoes may be used as a weapon, although they deal only 1HP damage in Java Edition. In Bedrock Edition, hoes can do as much as a pickaxe in terms of damage. Hoes use 1 durability when used as a weapon.
In Java Edition, golden hoes have an attack speed modifier -3 (refill in 1s).
Hoes always attack instantly in Bedrock Edition.

Trivia[edit | edit source]
Tilling a dirt block that has a dirt block on top of it changes it to farmland even though it cannot be used. If a hoe is used on a block horizontally adjacent to such a block, the first block reverts to dirt and the selected block is not tilled.
When a hoe breaks while tilling dirt, it does not display the tool breaking animation like on other tools, because tilling is not predicted client-side.

Mob loot[edit | edit source]
Zombies, husks, skeletons, strays, bogged, piglins, and zombified piglins have a small chance to spawn wearing armor. There is a 8.5% chance (9.5% with Looting I, 10.5% with Looting II and 11.5% with Looting III) for the mob to drop the leggings they're wearing upon death unless they are spawned from an ominous trial spawner. The dropped leggings is usually badly damaged, and may be enchanted with enchantment levels 5-19.
Usage[edit | edit source]
When worn, golden leggings provide 3 () armor points.
Piglins[edit | edit source]
As with other pieces of gold armor, piglins do not attack players wearing golden leggings unless provoked or attacked.
Piglins are also attracted towards golden leggings on the ground and equip them after inspecting them.

Usage[edit | edit source]
Breaking[edit | edit source]
A sword can also be used to destroy certain blocks 50% quicker, sometimes much quicker than with fists. Using a sword to destroy any block that doesn't break instantly by hand decreases its durability by 2; this includes bamboo, despite that the sword is the fastest tool for breaking it.[1]
If a sword is enchanted with Silk Touch, either using Creative or commands, cobwebs hit by the sword drop the cobwebs themselves instead of the usual string, because a sword is classified as the proper tool for cobwebs.
Creative mode[edit | edit source]
In Creative mode, swords are unable to break blocks. However, they can still break placed entities such as minecarts, paintings, item frames,‌[Java Edition only] and armor stands.[2][3]
Attacking[edit | edit source]
Main article: Sword § Attacking
A golden sword is used to deal damage to mobs and entities by attacking them. Golden swords sword have 4HP base damage in Java Edition and 5HP base damage in Bedrock Edition, and can be enchanted to deal more damage.

Obtaining[edit | edit source]
The heart of the sea must be found. It cannot be crafted or obtained by trading, making it a non-renewable resource.
A heart of the sea is obtained from a buried treasure. The location is marked with a noticeable red X on a buried treasure map, which is found in ocean ruins and shipwrecks. Feeding raw cod or raw salmon to a dolphin causes the dolphin to swim toward the nearest buried treasure, shipwreck, or ocean ruins.

A helmet (the leather variety being known as a cap and the type crafted from turtle scutes being known as a turtle shell) is a piece of armor that covers the head of the player. There are six primary types of helmets that are part of a full armor set: leather cap, chainmail helmet, iron helmet, diamond helmet, golden helmet and netherite helmet. A turtle shell is another kind of helmet that gives the Water Breathing effect, and can be used to brew potions of the Turtle Master.

There is a 8.5% chance (9.5% with Looting I, 10.5% with Looting II and 11.5% with Looting III) for the mob to drop the helmet they're wearing upon death, unless they are spawned from an ominous trial spawner. The dropped helmet is usually badly damaged, and may be enchanted with enchantment levels 5-19.
In Bedrock Edition, vindicators and pillagers spawned in raids have a 4.16% chance (5.128% on hard difficulty) to drop an iron helmet. The dropped helmet is usually badly damaged, and has a 50% chance of being enchanted with a random enchantment.

↑ When creating an enchantment offer, the game uses a random enchantment level from 5 – 19. The enchantments are never treasure enchantments.
Usage[edit | edit source]
Helmets can be placed in the top armor slot of a player's inventory for activation.
Defense points[edit | edit source]
Defense points are each signified by half of a shirt of mail in the armor bar above the health bar. Each defense point reduces any damage dealt to the player that is absorbed by armor by 4%, increasing additively with the number of defense points. Different materials and combinations of armor provide different levels of defense.
The following table shows the number of defense points added by helmets.
Material
Leather 1 ()
Golden 2 ()
Chainmail
Iron
Turtle shell
Diamond 3 ()
Netherite
Knockback resistance[edit | edit source]
A netherite helmet provides 10% knockback resistance.
Durability[edit | edit source]
The following table shows the amount of damage each piece of armor can absorb before being destroyed.
Any ""hit"" from a damage source that can be blocked by armor removes one point of durability from each piece of armor worn for every 4HP of incoming damage (rounded down, but never below 1). Damage taken that armor doesn't protect (such as falling or drowning) does not damage the armor, even if it is enchanted to protect against that type of damage. The following chart displays how many hits helmets can endure.
Netherite armor is not damaged by lava or fire when worn.

A helmet can be repaired in an anvil by adding units of the tiers' repair material, with each repair material restoring 25% the helmet's maximum durability, rounded down. Two helmets of the same tier can also be combined in an anvil. Both methods preserve the helmet's enchantments.
Enchantments[edit | edit source]
A helmet can receive the following enchantments. Note that while iron and chainmail have the same durability, chainmail has a higher enchantability than iron or diamond.

Armor trimming[edit | edit source]
It is possible to upgrade armor with trims. This requires a smithing template, a helmet, and an ingot or crystal (iron ingot, copper ingot, gold ingot, netherite ingot, emerald, redstone dust, lapis lazuli, amethyst shard, nether quartz, diamond, or resin brick).
These trims have no effect on the gameplay or strength of the armor.

↑ These durations ignore other influential factors (e.g. Mining Fatigue), and are measured in seconds. For more information, see Breaking § Speed.
Breaking any other block takes 0 durability if the block breaks instantly when broken by hand, or 1 otherwise.
Tilling[edit | edit source]
Hoes are used to turn dirt, grass blocks, and dirt paths into farmland. To till, press use on a grass or dirt block while holding a hoe. This does not work on mycelium or podzol,[1] nor does it work if there are other blocks on top of the targeted blocks, including snow layers or torches. However, mycelium and podzol can be first converted to dirt paths with a shovel, then tilled into farmland with a hoe.
Hoes can be used to convert coarse dirt into regular dirt by pressing use on the coarse dirt. Similar to tilling dirt, the space above the coarse dirt must be empty for it to be tilled.
Hoes can also be used on rooted dirt, which turns it into normal dirt, and yields a hanging roots item.
Tilling is effectively instantaneous, regardless of material, and uses 1 durability. Breaking blocks with a hoe uses 0 or 1 durability, depending on the block.
Hoes are unable to work on blocks with a plant on top, even if that plant could normally be placed on top of farmland without reverting it to dirt.[2]
Weapon[edit | edit source]
A hoe loses 2 points of durability when used as a weapon. Hoes may be used as a weapon, although they deal only 1HP damage in Java Edition, identical to that of a bare hand. In Bedrock Edition, hoes do equal damage to pickaxes of the same tier.
Java Edition[edit | edit source]
Hoes have differing attack speeds depending on the material, and all deal 1HP damage.
Material Wooden Gold Stone Iron Diamond Netherite
Attack damage 1HP 1HP 1HP 1HP 1HP 1HP
Attack speed 1 1 2 3 4 4
Damage per second (DPS) 1 1 2 2[note 1] 2[note 1] 2[note 1]

↑
a b c Effective DPS is limited at 2 due to the 0.5 second invulnerabity timer.
↑ The formula to find the total lifetime damage is ceil(durability ÷ 2) × damage per hit. The durability is halved then ceiled because hoes take double durability when used as a weapon, and the last 1 durability can also deal damage. The formula also ignores enchantments and critical hits, and assumes each attack is performed at maximum charge.
Bedrock Edition[edit | edit source]
In Bedrock Edition, hoes have no attack cooldown, and deal the following damage:
Material Wooden Gold Stone Iron Diamond Netherite
Attack damage 3HP 3HP 4HP 5HP 6HP 7HP
Durability 60 33 132 251 1562 2032

A hoe can be repaired in an anvil by adding units of the tiers' repair material, with each repair material restoring 25% the hoe's maximum durability, rounded down. Two hoes of the same tier can also be combined in an anvil. Both methods preserve the hoe's enchantments.
Enchantments[edit | edit source]
A hoe can receive the following enchantments:

Issues[edit | edit source]
Issues relating to ""Hoe"" are maintained on the bug tracker. Issues should be reported and viewed there.
Trivia[edit | edit source]
Tilling a dirt block that has a dirt block on top of it changes it to farmland even though it cannot be used. If a hoe is used on a block horizontally adjacent to such a block, the first block reverts to dirt and the selected block is not tilled.
When a hoe breaks while tilling dirt, it does not display the tool breaking animation like on other tools, because tilling is not predicted client-side.

Harvesting[edit | edit source]
A honey bottle can be obtained by using a glass bottle on either a beehive or bee nest with a honey level of 5. Doing this angers any bees inside, causing them to attack the player, unless there is a campfire or another block on fire within 5 blocks below the nest or hive. Using normal fire would likely cause the nest, bees, and flowers around it to burn.
A dispenser with glass bottles can be used to collect the honey without angering the bees. The honey bottle appears as an item in the dispenser's inventory. If the dispenser is full, the honey bottle is shot out.
Usage[edit | edit source]
To drink a honey bottle, press and hold use while it is selected in the hotbar. Drinking one restores 6 () hunger and 1.2 hunger saturation and returns a glass bottle. Consuming the item also has the benefit of removing any Poison effect applied to the player. Unlike drinking milk, other applied effects are not removed upon drinking a honey bottle.
Honey bottles can be drunk even with a full hunger bar. Drinking a honey bottle takes 25% longer than eating other food - 2 seconds - and has a unique sound.

When a bee nest or beehive at honey_level 5 is sheared, it drops 3 honeycombs and angers any bees inside, causing them to attack. Having a lit campfire or lighting a fire underneath the nest or hive prevents the bees from becoming hostile.
A dispenser with shears inside can be used to shear the nest without angering the bees. The honeycomb pops out as a dropped item.

Crafting recipe
Leather

Only leather horse armor can be crafted; other horse armor can be obtained only from chest loot from structures listed above.
Trading[edit | edit source]
Expert-level leatherworker villagers sell leather horse armor for 6 emeralds as part of their trade.
Usage[edit | edit source]
Only normal adult horses can wear armor; foals, donkeys, mules, and undead variants such as skeleton horses and zombie horses cannot be equipped with armor.
Types[edit | edit source]
Horse armor has leather, iron, gold, and diamond variants. It does not have netherite, chainmail or turtle scute variants.
Armor stands[edit | edit source]
Horse armor cannot be placed or displayed on armor stands as it would be on a horse.
Protection[edit | edit source]
Horse armor can be equipped to horses either by manually placing it in its respective slot by pressing inventory while riding the horse (), or by using the horse with it.
There is a gradual increase in the defense given from a horse wearing the different types of armor. Note that golden horse armor provides more protection than iron horse armor, whereas the opposite is true for player armor. Diamond horse armor is the only horse armor type to provide any armor toughness.
Material Armor Armor toughness
Leather 3 () 0
Iron 5 () 0
Gold 7 () 0
Diamond 11 ( × 5.5) 2
If a horse dies while equipped with any horse armor, it drops its normal loot, a saddle (if it had one), and the horse armor.
Leather horse armor protects horses from freezing in powder snow, but it does not negate other powder snow effects (e.g., falling through, inability to jump).
Durability[edit | edit source]
Unlike player armor, horse armor does not have durability. This means a single horse armor can be used infinitely unless destroyed.
Enchanting[edit | edit source]
Unlike player armor, horse armor cannot be enchanted in Survival mode. However, in Java Edition Creative mode, horse armor can be used with an anvil to enchant with Thorns, Feather Falling, Protection, Fire Protection, Projectile Protection, Blast Protection, Curse of Binding, and Curse of Vanishing. Other enchantments can be applied, but they have no effect.
Dyeing[edit | edit source]
Main article: Dyeing § Dyeing armor
Leather horse armor can be dyed by combining it with dye(s) through crafting‌[JE only] or by using it on a cauldron containing dyed water.‌[BE only] Using leather horse armor on a cauldron containing ordinary water removes any dye from it.

Obtaining[edit | edit source]
Throwing a potato, poisonous potato, or a baked potato into lava turns it into a hot potato, which is then ejected from lava in a random direction[more information needed]. The hot potato retains data from the original potato, such as its custom name, or how many times it has been lubricated.
Crafting[edit | edit source]

Crafting recipe
Baked Potato +
Lava Bucket

Usage[edit | edit source]
Damage[edit | edit source]
Each hot potato stores a heat value. This value starts from 0 and goes up by 1 every tick it is in a player's inventory to a maximum of 200. Once the heat value reaches 20 and the potato is in a player's inventory, the player begins taking damage. Based on the heat value, a player takes between 1HP and 5HP damage each tick. However, due to damage immunity, the player only actually takes damage every 10 game ticks (0.5 seconds).
Fire Resistance does not prevent the player from taking damage from happening. If there are multiple hot potatoes in a player's inventory, the effect is the same as if there was only one. Hot potatoes do not damage other entities if they hold the item.
Food[edit | edit source]
Eating a hot potato restores 5 () hunger. When a hot potato is consumed, the player is set on fire for 16940 ticks, or 847 seconds.
Burning immunity[edit | edit source]
Hot potato can't be burned in fire or lava, like netherite items.
Hot potato item jumps in lava.

Result Materials needed

Ice Bomb
Sodium Acetate x4
Usage[edit | edit source]
Ice bombs can be thrown by using them, similar to an egg. They are affected by gravity.
Similar to ender pearls, there is a short cooldown before the player can throw another ice bomb. The cooldown is shown in the hotbar by a white overlay that shrinks before the player is able to use it again.
Ice bombs explode upon hitting most blocks, including non-solid blocks, but not air. They also explode upon hitting other entities, but they do not take any damage, and unlike eggs and snowballs, the impact is not considered an attack and does no damage or knockback. When exploding, any water (including flowing water, but not waterlogged blocks) in a 3×3×3 cube around the ice bomb freezes into ice. Ice bombs can be used to contain and displace mobs in ice under water.
While endermen teleport away from arrows shot at them, they can be hit by ice bombs.
Throwing an ice bomb while underwater encloses the player in ice.
In Minecraft Education, breezes are able to deflect ice bombs.

Mob loot[edit | edit source]
Equipment[edit | edit source]
Main article: Drops § Equipped items
A vindicator spawns with an iron axe and has an 8.5% chance (9.5% with Looting I, 10.5% with Looting II, and 11.5% with Looting III) of dropping it upon death by the player. It is usually heavily damaged and is sometimes enchanted.
Raids[edit | edit source]
In Bedrock Edition, Vindicator and pillagers that spawn in raids have a 4.1% chance (5.12% on hard) to drop a badly-damaged iron axe, which is sometimes enchanted with a random enchantment. A vindicator can drop 2 iron axes, one from natural equipment and one from raid drops.
Trading[edit | edit source]
Villager Probability Villager wants Player receives
JE BE
Journeyman Toolsmith 40% 25% 6–20 × Emerald Enchanted Iron Axe[t 1]
Novice Weaponsmith 67% 100% 3 × Emerald Iron Axe
↑ When creating an enchantment offer, the game uses a random enchantment level from 5 – 19. The enchantments are never treasure enchantments.
Villager gifts[edit | edit source]
Weaponsmith villagers occasionally throw iron axes at players with the Hero of the Village status effect.‌[Java Edition only]
Usage[edit | edit source]
Breaking[edit | edit source]
Iron axes can break wood-related blocks faster than other tools. Breaking a block costs 1 durability.[note 1]
↑ Blocks that break instantly don't use up durability.
Stripping[edit | edit source]
Using an iron axe on a log, wood block, or block of bamboo turns it into a stripped log, stripped wood, or block of stripped bamboo, respectively. This costs 1 point of durability of the axe.
Copper blocks[edit | edit source]
Using an iron axe on a waxed or oxidized copper block removes the wax if it has any, or otherwise remove a level of oxidization. This costs 1 point of durability.
Weapon[edit | edit source]
When used as a weapon, an iron axe loses 2 durability points.
Java Edition[edit | edit source]
Attacking a shield user with an axe disables the use of the shield for 5 seconds. Vindicators, piglin brutes, or other mobs with commands always disable the player's shield. Damage done when using an axe as a weapon is more than that of a sword of the same tier, though they take longer than a sword to recover, resulting in lower DPS.
Attack Damage Attack Speed Recovery time DPS Lifetime damage inflicted[note 1]
9HP 0.9 1.11 seconds (22.2 game ticks) 8.1 1125HP × 562.5
↑ The formula to find the total lifetime damage is ceil(durability ÷ 2) × damage per hit. The durability is halved then ceiled because axes take double durability when used as a weapon, and the last 1 durability can also deal damage. The formula also ignores enchantments and critical hits, and assumes each attack is performed at maximum charge.
Bedrock Edition[edit | edit source]
Iron axes attack instantly with no cooldown and deal 5HP damage, but they lower the durability of armor and shields faster than a sword would do.

Mob loot[edit | edit source]
Zombies, husks, skeletons, strays, bogged, piglins, and zombified piglins have a small chance to spawn wearing armor. There is a 8.5% chance (9.5% with Looting I, 10.5% with Looting II and 11.5% with Looting III) for the mob to drop the boots they're wearing upon death unless they are spawned from an ominous trial spawner. The dropped boots are usually badly damaged, and may be enchanted with enchantment levels 5-19.

In Bedrock Edition, vindicators and pillagers spawning in raids have a 4.16% chance (5.128% on hard difficulty) to drop iron boots. The dropped boots are usually badly damaged, and have a 50% chance of being enchanted with a random enchantment.

Iron hoes are tools used to break plant-based blocks such as hay bales quicker and are also used to till dirt into farmland. They can also quickly break other blocks such as sculk-related blocks.

Usage[edit | edit source]
Main article: Hoe § Usage
Harvesting[edit | edit source]
Hoes are used to harvest various plant blocks, fungi, and sculk blocks more quickly. Breaking one of these blocks takes 1 durability.
Breaking any other block takes 0 durability if the block breaks instantly when broken by hand, or 1 otherwise.
Tilling[edit | edit source]
Hoes are used to turn dirt, grass blocks, and dirt paths into farmland. To till, press use on a grass or dirt block while holding a hoe. This does not work on mycelium or podzol,[1] nor does it work if there are other blocks on top of the targeted blocks, including snow layers or torches. However, mycelium and podzol can be first converted to dirt paths with a shovel, then tilled into farmland with a hoe.
Hoes can be used to convert coarse dirt into regular dirt by pressing use on the coarse dirt. Similar to tilling dirt, the space above the coarse dirt must be empty for it to be tilled.
Hoes can also be used on rooted dirt, which turns it into normal dirt, and yields a hanging roots item.
Tilling is effectively instantaneous, regardless of material, and uses 1 durability. Breaking blocks with a hoe uses 0 or 1 durability, depending on the block.
Hoes are unable to work on blocks with a plant on top, even if that plant could normally be placed on top of farmland without reverting it to dirt.[2]
Weapon[edit | edit source]
Hoes may be used as a weapon, although they deal only 1HP damage in Java Edition. In Bedrock Edition, hoes can do as much as a pickaxe in terms of damage. Hoes use 1 durability when used as a weapon.
In Java Edition, iron hoes have an attack speed modifier -1 (refill in 0.33s).
Hoes always attack instantly in Bedrock Edition.

Iron Hoe
A hoe can be repaired in an anvil by adding iron ingots, with each ingot restoring 25% the hoe's maximum durability, rounded down. Two iron hoes can also be combined in an anvil. Both methods preserve the hoe's enchantments.
Enchantments[edit | edit source]
A hoe can receive the following enchantments:
Name Description Max Level Method Weight
Efficiency Increases the mining speed. V Enchanting Table or Anvil 10
Fortune[note 1] Increases the amount of drops when mining. III Enchanting Table or Anvil 2
Silk Touch[note 1] Causes blocks to drop themselves when mined. I Enchanting Table or Anvil 1

Trivia[edit | edit source]
Tilling a dirt block that has a dirt block on top of it changes it to farmland even though it cannot be used. If a hoe is used on a block horizontally adjacent to such a block, the first block reverts to dirt and the selected block is not tilled.
When a hoe breaks while tilling dirt, it does not display the tool breaking animation like on other tools, because tilling is not predicted client-side.

Iron golems drop 3-5 iron ingots upon death, regardless of the way they die. The Looting enchantment does not increase the amount of iron ingots dropped.
Zombies, husks, and zombie villagers have a 2.5% (1⁄40) chance of dropping either an iron ingot, carrot, or potato when killed by a player or tamed wolf. This is increased by 1% (1⁄100) per level of looting. This gives iron ingots the following chances of dropping:
1⁄120 (about 0.83%)
7⁄600 (about 1.17%) with Looting I
9⁄600 (1.50%) with Looting II

Mob loot[edit | edit source]
Zombies, husks, skeletons, strays, bogged, piglins, and zombified piglins have a small chance to spawn wearing armor. There is a 8.5% chance (9.5% with Looting I, 10.5% with Looting II and 11.5% with Looting III) for the mob to drop the leggings they're wearing upon death unless they are spawned from an ominous trial spawner. The dropped leggings are usually badly damaged, and may be enchanted with enchantment levels 5-19.
In Bedrock Edition, vindicators and pillagers spawning in raids have a 4.16% chance (5.128% on hard difficulty) to drop a pair of iron leggings. The dropped leggings are usually badly damaged, and have a 50% chance of being enchanted with a random enchantment.

Armor trimming[edit | edit source]
It is possible to upgrade armor with trims. This requires a smithing template, a leggings, and an ingot or crystal (iron ingot, copper ingot, gold ingot, netherite ingot, emerald, redstone dust, lapis lazuli, amethyst shard, nether quartz, diamond, or resin brick).
These trims have no effect on the gameplay or strength of the armor.
