To break an activator rail, mine it:\nBlock Activator Rail\nHardness 0.7\nTool\nBreaking time (sec)[A]\nDefault 1.05\nWooden 0.55\nStone 0.3\nIron 0.2\nDiamond 0.15\nNetherite 0.15\nGolden 0.1\nOptions\nEfficiency\n0\nHaste\n0\nJE\nBE\nLegend\ndrops nothing\ndrops something other than the block itself\ndrops the block itself\nitalicized can be instant mined\n↑ These durations ignore other influential factors (e.g. Mining Fatigue), and are measured in seconds. For more information, see Breaking § Speed.\nAn activator rail also drops as an item when the block beneath it is removed or a piston moves it into a space with no floor below it.\nGenerated loot[edit | edit source]\nItem Structure Container Quantity\n[hide]\nChance\nJava Edition and Bedrock Edition\nActivator Rail Mineshaft Chest 1–4 27.1%\nCrafting[edit | edit source]\nIngredients\n[hide]\nCrafting recipe\nIron Ingot +\nStick +\nRedstone Torch\n\n6\nUsage[edit | edit source]\nAn activator rail can be used as a rail and as a redstone component.\nTo place an activator rail, use an activator rail item while pointing at a surface facing the space the activator rail should occupy. An activator rail can be placed on:\nthe top of any full solid opaque block (stone, dirt, blocks of gold, etc.), including full-block mechanism components (command blocks, dispensers, droppers, note blocks, and redstone lamps)\nthe top of a hopper, upside-down slab, or upside-down stairs.\nthe top of any transparent block (glass, etc.)\nAn activator rail cannot be attached to the side or bottom of any block, but attempting to make such an attachment may cause the activator rail to attach to the top of a block under the destination space. For example, if a fence is on the ground, attempting to attach an activator rail to the side of the fence causes the activator rail to be attached to the top of the ground next to the fence instead.\nWhen placed, an activator rail configures itself to line up with any adjacent rails (including detector rails, powered rails, and other activator rails), as well as adjacent rails one block up. The behaviors in Java and Bedrock editions diverge in the following ways.\nIn Java Edition:\nIf there are two adjacent rails on non-opposite sides, or three or more adjacent rails, or no adjacent rails at all, an activator rail aligns itself in the direction the player is facing. If an existing activator rail is connected to only one other rail or none at all, and a new rail is placed perpendicular to the activator rail, then the activator rail aligns itself in the east-west direction (if it isn't already facing that way). If a rail it would align with is one block up, an activator rail slants upward toward it (with multiple options to slant upward to, an activator rail \"prefers\" west or south). Other configurations can be created by placing and removing various rails.[needs testing]\nIn Bedrock Edition:\nIf there are two adjacent rails on non-opposite sides, or three or more adjacent rails, an activator rail aligns itself in the east-west direction. If there are no adjacent rails, an activator rail aligns itself in the north-south direction (but if a rail is later placed to the east or west, the activator rail re-orients itself in the east-west direction even if it is already connected to another rail to the north or south). If a rail it would align with is one block up, an activator rail slants upward toward it (with multiple options to slant upward to, an activator rail \"prefers\", in order: west, east, south, and north). Other configurations can be created by placing and removing various rails.\nIt cannot be placed suspended in midair, even with commands.[1]\nRail[edit | edit source]\nMain article: Rail\nActivator rails (and other rails) can be used as \"roads\" for minecarts. A minecart that enters an activator rail's space from either end of the activator rail continues to move, losing only a little velocity (which can then be increased again with powered rails). A minecart that enters an activator rail's space from the side turns east or south (depending on the activator rail's orientation), or in the downward direction for a slanted activator rail.\nRedstone component[edit | edit source]\nSee also: Redstone circuit\nActivator rails can be used to affect minecarts that travel over them.\nActivation\nAn activator rail is a redstone mechanism and can be activated by:\nan adjacent active power component (for example, a redstone torch, a block of redstone, a daylight sensor, etc.)\nan adjacent powered block (strongly-powered or weakly-powered)\na powered redstone comparator or redstone repeater facing the activator rail\npowered redstone dust configured to point at the activator rail, or configured as a plus sign. An activator rail is not activated by adjacent powered redstone dust that is configured to point in another direction.\nAn activated activator rail also activates any adjacent activator rails it is connected to, up to eight away from the original activation source. Thus a single activation source can activate up to 17 rails (one original in the middle and eight on either side). An activated activator rail does not activate adjacent rails not connected to it.\nActivation and deactivation are instant and occur in the same gametick the power source turns on or off (any eventual delay depends on the power source).\nBehavior\nAn activator rail affects minecarts above it with varying effects that occur as soon as any part of the minecart is on the activator rail.\nAn active activator rail:\nstarts shaking, and ejects mobs (including players) from minecarts — the destination location is picked the same way as when dismounting a minecart\nrepeatedly activates minecarts with command blocks — a command block minecart executes its command every four game ticks until the command block minecart is no longer on the activator rail\ndisables minecarts with hoppers — a disabled hopper minecart cannot pick up items it travels through until it is enabled by an inactive activator rail (or until it is broken and re-placed)\nprimes minecarts with TNT — primed TNT minecarts explode after four seconds with an explosive power proportional to their speed over the activator rail.\nAn inactive activator rail enables minecarts with hoppers — an enabled hopper minecart picks up items it travels through until it is disabled by an active activator rail.\nA hopper minecart stops picking up items in the same tick it touches an active activator rail or in the same tick the inactive rail it is standing on is powered (it does not collect the item it could have taken from a container above in the same tick the activator rail turns on and takes the first item in the same tick the rail turns off again).\nMob interaction[edit | edit source]\nLike other types of rails, spiders, cave spiders, and wardens are the only land mobs that can walk onto activator rails.‌[Java Edition only]\nSounds[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition:\n[hide]\nv t e\nmetal sound type\nSound Subtitles Source Description Resource location Translation key Volume Pitch Attenuation\ndistance\nBlock broken Blocks Once the block has broken block.metal.break subtitles.block.generic.break 1.0 1.2 16\nBlock placed Blocks When the block is placed block.metal.place subtitles.block.generic.place 1.0 1.2 16\nBlock breaking Blocks While the block is in the process of being broken block.metal.hit subtitles.block.generic.hit 0.25 0.75 16\nSomething falls on a block Entity-Dependent Falling on the block with fall damage block.metal.fall subtitles.block.generic.fall 0.5 1.25 16\nFootsteps Entity-Dependent Walking on the block block.metal.step subtitles.block.generic.footsteps 0.15 1.5 16\nBedrock Edition:\n[hide]\nv t e\nmetal sound type\nSound Source Description Resource location Volume Pitch\nBlocks Once the block has broken dig.stone 1.0 1.1-1.2\nBlocks When the block is placed use.stone 1.0 1.2-1.25\nBlocks While the block is in the process of being broken hit.stone 0.3 0.75\nPlayers Falling on the block with fall damage fall.stone 0.4 1.0\nPlayers Walking on the block step.stone 0.35 1.0\nBlocks Jumping from the block jump.stone 0.12 1.0\nBlocks Falling on the block without fall damage land.stone 0.22 1.0\nData values[edit | edit source]\nID[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition:\nName Identifier Form Block tags Item tags\n[hide]\nTranslation key\nActivator Rail activator_rail Block & Item prevent_mob_spawning_inside\nrails rails\nblock.minecraft.activator_rail\nBedrock Edition:\nName Identifier Numeric ID Form Item ID[i 1]\n[hide]\nTranslation key\nActivator Rail activator_rail 126 Block & Giveable Item[i 2] Identical[i 3]\ntile.activator_rail.name\n↑ ID of block's direct item form, which is used in savegame files and addons.\n↑ Available with /give command.\n↑ The block's direct item form has the same ID as the block.\nBlock states[edit | edit source]\nSee also: Block states\nJava Edition:\nName Default value Allowed values\n[hide]\nDescription\npowered false false\ntrue True if rail is activated.\nshape north_south east_west\nnorth_south Specifies the rail's orientation.\nascending_east\nascending_north\nascending_south\nascending_west A rail that ascends toward the direction noted.\nFor example, an ascending_west rail is a straight rail that goes upward from the east toward the west.\nwaterlogged false false\ntrue Whether or not there's water in the same place as this rail.\nBedrock Edition:\nName Metadata Bits Default value Allowed values Values for\nMetadata Bits\n[hide]\nDescription\nrail_data_bit 0x8 false false\ntrue 0\n1 True if rail is activated.\nrail_direction 0x1\n0x2\n0x4 0 0 0 flat track going north-south\n1 1 flat track going east-west\n2 2 sloped track ascending to the east\n3 3 sloped track ascending to the west\n4 4 sloped track ascending to the north\n5 5 sloped track ascending to the south\n6\n7\n8\n9 Unsupported Unused\nHistory[edit | edit source]\n[hide]\nJava Edition\n1.5 13w02a\n\nAdded activator rails.\n13w02b The crafting recipe of activator rails has now been changed to include sticks and redstone torch.

Whether alliums can generate depends on the flower gradients.\nIn Bedrock Edition, when bone meal is applied to an allium in any biome, more alliums appear on top of nearby grass blocks. The flowers can appear up to 3 blocks away from the original, forming a 7×7 square.\nMob loot[edit | edit source]\nIn Java Edition, endermen can pick up alliums, like any other one-block-tall flower, and drop it if killed while holding it.\nGenerated loot[edit | edit source]\nIn Bedrock Edition, 8 alliums are found inside the chest in the \"allium room\" in woodland mansions.

The maximum amount of amethyst shards dropped can be increased with Fortune; Fortune I gives a 1⁄3 chance for 8 shards (averaging 5.33 shards), Fortune II gives a 25% chance (each) to give 8 or 12 shards (averaging 7 shards), and Fortune III gives a 20% chance (each) to give 8, 12, or 16 shards (averaging 8.8 shards).\nBlock Amethyst Cluster\nAmethyst Bud\nHardness 1.5\nTool\nBreaking time (sec)[A]\nDefault 2.25\nWooden 1.15\nStone 0.6\nIron 0.4\nDiamond 0.3\nNetherite 0.25\nGolden 0.2\nLegend\ndrops nothing\ndrops something other than the block itself\ndrops the block itself\nitalicized can be instant mined\n↑ These durations ignore other influential factors (e.g. Mining Fatigue), and are measured in seconds. For more information, see Breaking § Speed.\nNatural generation[edit | edit source]\nAmethyst buds and clusters generate naturally as part of amethyst geodes, on exposed faces of budding amethysts.\nPost-generation[edit | edit source]\nEvery time a budding amethyst block receives a random tick, there is a 20% chance for a small amethyst bud to generate on any of its sides, as long as the block being replaced with the small amethyst bud is air or a water source block.\nUsage[edit | edit source]\nGrowing into amethyst clusters[edit | edit source]\nAn amethyst bud placed on a budding amethyst (rather than any other block) regardless whether it was placed by the player or spawned by the budding amethyst itself, grows over time, going through three growth stages – small, medium, and large – before reaching its 4th and final growth stage as an amethyst cluster, which drops amethyst shards when mined.\nIn Java Edition, the below logic can be applied:\nPer random tick, updates occur to any given block in the loaded chunk every 68.27 seconds on average if the chunk center is within 128 blocks of a player's location.\nEach random tick assigned to the budding amethyst block has a 20% chance of creating a new amethyst bud or incrementing the growth stage on one randomly-selected side of the six-sided block. And if the randomly-selected side is obstructed, then it fails and nothing happens.\nThere are 4 growth stages.\nAs such, the math can be applied if a player is within random tick range as:\n(68.27 seconds average for random ticks) × (20% chance of growth for any given single side) × (6 sides) × (4 growth stages) = 68.27×5×6×4 = 8192.4 seconds average, also 2 hours 16 minutes 32.4 seconds, also 6.827 in-game days.\nDecoration[edit | edit source]\nThey can also be placed on certain other types of blocks for decoration. The block must be solid and have at least side sides that form a full surface: for example, they can be placed on the bottom of stairs (or top of upside down stairs), but not on their side, or top. They can also be placed on the bottom of bottom slabs and on the top of top slabs. Of blocks that meet these criteria, some are still excluded.\nAmethyst clusters cannot be placed on:\nAll non-solid blocks;\nblocks without any full surfaces, like fences, fence gates, walls, glass panes, iron bars, lightning rods, chains, heads, grindstones, bells, lanterns, cauldrons, anvils, conduits, decorated pots, chests, pointed dripstone;\nleaves;\nbig dripleaf;\nhoney blocks;\nchorus flowers.\nLight[edit | edit source]\nSmall, medium, and large amethyst buds give off a light level of 1, 2 and 4 respectively, while amethyst clusters give off a light level of 5.\nSound[edit | edit source]\nUniquely among other blocks an amethyst cluster in all its growth stages makes a quiet overlay sound when generally interacted with as well as its block breaking sound when hit with a projectile.\nSounds[edit | edit source]\nList of sounds [show] [edit]\nData values[edit | edit source]\nID[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition:\nName Identifier Form\n[hide]\nTranslation key\nSmall Amethyst Bud small_amethyst_bud Block & Item\nblock.minecraft.small_amethyst_bud\nMedium Amethyst Bud medium_amethyst_bud Block & Item\nblock.minecraft.medium_amethyst_bud\nLarge Amethyst Bud large_amethyst_bud Block & Item\nblock.minecraft.large_amethyst_bud\nAmethyst Cluster amethyst_cluster Block & Item\nblock.minecraft.amethyst_cluster\nBedrock Edition:\nName Identifier Numeric ID Form Item ID[i 1]\n[hide]\nTranslation key\nSmall Amethyst Bud small_amethyst_bud 587 Block & Giveable Item[i 2] Identical[i 3]\n(Numeric: -332)\ntile.small_amethyst_bud.name\nMedium Amethyst Bud medium_amethyst_bud 586 Block & Giveable Item[i 2] Identical[i 3]\n(Numeric: -331)\ntile.medium_amethyst_bud.name\nLarge Amethyst Bud large_amethyst_bud 585 Block & Giveable Item[i 2] Identical[i 3]\n(Numeric: -330)\ntile.large_amethyst_bud.name\nAmethyst Cluster amethyst_cluster 584 Block & Giveable Item[i 2] Identical[i 3]\n(Numeric: -329)\ntile.amethyst_cluster.name\n↑ ID of block's direct item form, which is used in savegame files and addons.\n↑\na b c d Available with /give command.\n↑\na b c d The block's direct item form has the same ID as the block.\nBlock states[edit | edit source]\nSee also: Block states\nJava Edition:\nName Default value Allowed values\n[hide]\nDescription\nfacing up down\neast\nnorth\nsouth\nup\nwest The direction the amethyst is facing, determined by its anchoring.\nwaterlogged false true\nfalse Whether or not the amethyst is located inside of water.\nBedrock Edition:\nName Metadata Bits Default value Allowed values Values for\nMetadata Bits\n[hide]\nDescription\nminecraft:block_face Not Supported up down\neast\nnorth\nsouth\nup\nwest Unsupported The direction the amethyst is facing, determined by its anchoring.\n\nHistory[edit | edit source]\nThere is an associated page listing all historical changes related to the appearance and/or sounds associated with this block in further detail than below; see /Asset history.\nMay 21, 2009 Notch mentioned crystal blocks as a potential block type that can be found in the underground.\nOctober 3, 2020 Amethyst clusters are shown at Minecraft Live 2020.\nOctober 20, 2020 Cory Scheviak reveals small and medium amethyst buds on Twitter.\n[hide]\nJava Edition\n1.17 20w45a\nAdded amethyst buds and amethyst clusters.\n20w46a Amethyst buds can now be obtained with Silk Touch.[1]\n21w11a Breaking amethyst clusters by hand, with a piston, or by other means now drops 2 amethyst shards instead of the 4 that it does when broken with a pickaxe.\nPreviously, only an iron pickaxe or higher could cause 4 amethyst shards to drop, and other means dropped nothing.\n21w17a Removed unused 'lit' blockstate.\n?

[note 2] As of Java Edition 1.16.5, on average they generate 1.56 ores per chunk. Given this number, and that there are 32768 blocks in a chunk (16×128×16), there is approximately a 0.004% chance that any randomly selected block will be an ancient debris block.\nGenerated loot[edit | edit source]\nAncient debris can appear in bastion chests, either as a singular item or as a stack of two items.

A damaged anvil can also generate in trail ruins.\nCrafting[edit | edit source]\nA total of 31 iron ingots (including 27 for three blocks of iron) are required to craft an anvil.\nIngredients\n[hide]\nCrafting recipe\nBlock of Iron +\nIron Ingot\n\nUsage[edit | edit source]\nRepairing and renaming items[edit | edit source]\nThe GUI of the anvil.\nMain article: Anvil mechanics\nAnvils have two modes to repair items that have a durability rating:\nAs with the grindstone, a player may repair items by combining two similar items. With the anvil, however, the target retains its enchantments and may gain new ones from the sacrificed items.\nAlternatively, a player can use materials originally required in the crafting of the item (iron ingots for iron items with durability, diamonds for diamond items with durability) to repair a single item. One material can repair 25% of the target's maximum durability. This is a good deal in the case of a chestplate, for example; a full repair (four materials) would total only half of the item's original cost (eight materials). In the case of tools and weapons, however, this may be a significantly less economical option; combining two diamond shovels would cost two diamonds in total, while up to four diamonds could be required to directly repair one. Still, it may be worth making the more expensive upgrade if the enchantments are considered difficult to obtain.\nIf the items are unable to be combined, a red \"X\" appears over the arrow pointing to the slot of the resulting item. Also, if the target item is at full durability and the sacrifice does not have any enchantments, the anvil also refuses to combine the items, unless if renaming the item to a valid name.\nIn addition, the player can rename any item – not just items with durability – by using an anvil.\nRepairing[edit | edit source]\nSee also: Repair\nExample showing a repair of two diamond pickaxes.\nRepairing with materials works for the most part, but not with all items: in general, repairing works for items with their material in the default name. For example, an anvil can repair an iron pickaxe with materials (iron in this case) while an anvil cannot repair bows or shears except with other bows or shears. Special cases: chain armor can be repaired with iron ingots, turtle shells can be repaired with turtle scutes, maces can be repaired with breeze rods, and elytra can be repaired with phantom membranes. The repair does not need to be complete; one material repairs 1⁄4 of the item's maximum durability. Repair of an unenchanted item can cost more material than simply crafting a new item or combining damaged items. The exception is armor, which consumes less material at the cost of experience levels.\nRepairing with a matching item works for any item with durability including bows, shears and so on. The items must be a matching tool and of a matching material. For example, a golden pickaxe cannot combine with a golden sword or iron pickaxe.\nIn both cases, the resulting durability is limited to the item's maximum, and there is no discount for \"over-repair\".\nAs a subset of repairing one item with another, the anvil can transfer enchantments from the sacrifice to the target. This can have a synergistic effect when both items share identical enchantments, or simply add to each other when they do not. Two Sharpness II swords can be combined to make a Sharpness III sword, for example, or a pickaxe with Efficiency can be combined with one that has Unbreaking. This can produce enchantments and combinations that are not possible with an enchanting table. But even so, some enchantments cannot be combined if they are similar, or contradicting, in terms of what they do. If the target is damaged, the player has to pay for the repair as well as the transfer.\nTransferring high-level enchantments is more expensive, and renaming an item has an additional surcharge. The anvil has a limit of 39 levels; beyond that, repairs are refused. This limit is not present in Creative mode.\nEvery time armor or tools are repaired, the minimum experience cost doubles (e.g., 1 level, 2 levels, 4 levels, 8 levels, etc.).\nRenaming[edit | edit source]\nAny item or stack of items can be renamed at a cost of one level plus any prior-work penalty. If the player is only renaming, the maximum total cost is 39 levels. The maximum length for renaming is 30 characters‌[BE only] or 50 characters‌[JE only]. Some items have special effects when renamed:\nA name tag must be renamed before it can be used.\nRenaming a bucket of fish, axolotl, or tadpole renames the mob inside as well, meaning a fish, axolotl or tadpole can be named without a name tag.‌[Java Edition only][1]\nA renamed item (can be any item, doesn't need to be a weapon) that kills another player or tamed mob causes the name to appear in the death message.‌[Java Edition only]\nA renamed spawn egg produces a mob with the same name.\nChests, trapped chests, shulker boxes, furnaces, hoppers, droppers, dispensers, minecarts with chests, minecarts with hoppers, enchantment tables, barrels, smokers, blast furnaces and brewing stands display the name in their GUI when placed.\nRenamed command blocks use their name in chat messages instead of [@].\nAny name changes to items are applied to the data tag {Item:{tag:{display:{Name:\"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"<name>\\\"}\"}}}}. Similarly, this data tag can be accessed by the nbt argument using target selectors.\nIf the item name field is left blank, or is only whitespace or non-breaking spaces (or a combination of both), the default name for that item is used instead. Also, if the item name is unchanged from its current name (which can occur when renaming an item for the first time and using any of the aforementioned blank parameters), a red \"X\" appears on top of the arrow in the GUI.\nNamed items do not stack with unnamed or differently-named items of the same type.\nEnchanted books[edit | edit source]\nEnchanted books can be used to enchant tools, armor and weapons. Enchanted books themselves can be combined to create higher-tiered books. This makes an anvil an alternative to the enchantment table.\nFalling anvils[edit | edit source]\nFalling Anvil\nJava Edition\nBedrock Edition\nHitbox size\nHeight: 0.98 Blocks\nWidth: 0.98 Blocks\nMain article: Falling Block\nWhen there is no supporting block below an anvil, the anvil falls in the same way sand, gravel, concrete powder, and dragon eggs fall. A placed anvil cannot be pushed or pulled by pistons,‌[Java Edition only] but a falling anvil can be pushed (though cannot be pulled), as it is an entity. This is different in Bedrock Edition where anvils can be pushed and pulled by pistons. Anvils make a metallic clang sound when they land.\nA falling anvil damages any player or mob that it falls on. The damage amount depends on fall distance: 2HP per block fallen after the first (e.g., an anvil that falls 4 blocks deals 6HP damage). The damage is capped at 40HP × 20, no matter how far the anvil falls. Helmets take twice as much durability damage as other armor pieces, but do not provide any special protection other than the normal armor damage reduction.[2] When a player dies by an anvil falling on them, the death message \"<player> was squashed by a falling anvil\" appears. However, if a player is merely touched by a falling anvil entity, no damage is dealt unless the falling anvil becomes an anvil block in the same block where the player is located.\nIf an anvil falls onto a block with a solid top surface, but the same block it is in cannot be replaced (torch, slab, etc.), it breaks and drops as an item.\nAn anvil can fall into the void if there is a straight path to it.\nWhen an anvil entity is in perpetual motion using slime blocks, it breaks after about 30 seconds.\nMaps[edit | edit source]\nMain article: Map\nAn anvil can be used instead of a crafting table to zoom a map out, to clone a map, or to place a player position marker on a map.‌[Bedrock Edition only]\nName Ingredients Anvil usage Description\nMap or Locator Map (zoomed out) Map or Locator Map +\nPaper\nMap\n8\n‌[Bedrock Edition only]\nSupplying 8 sheets of paper results in a zoomed-out version of the input map.\nMap or Locator Map (cloned) Map or Locator Map +\nEmpty Map\nMap\n2\n‌[Bedrock Edition only]\nOnly one copy can be made at a time.\nThe non-empty input map must be a locator map for the output to be a locator map. An empty locator map is the same as an empty map for this recipe.\nLocator Map Map +\nCompass\nMap\n‌[Bedrock Edition only]\nMaps crafted with only paper do not show the location marker; to add it, a compass must be added to the map.\nBecoming damaged[edit | edit source]\nWith each use, an anvil has a 12% chance to become damaged – degrading one stage at a time, first becoming chipped, then damaged, then eventually destroyed. An anvil typically survives for 25 uses on average or approximately one use per 1.24 iron ingots used in crafting the anvil.\nAn anvil can be damaged and destroyed from falling. If it falls from a height greater than one block, the chance of degrading by one stage is 5% × the number of blocks fallen.\nThe damage state does not affect the anvil's function, but only anvils of the same damage state can stack in inventory.\nWhen an anvil is destroyed, the player automatically leaves the anvil GUI and it disappears.\nCreative mode[edit | edit source]\nIn creative mode, the anvil functions a little differently than other game modes:\nAny repair/enchant/rename operation may be done, regardless of the player's experience level. In Java Edition, incompatible enchantments are allowed as well.\nThe experience cost is not taken from the player.\nThe repair cost of tools does still increase.\nIt continues doubling with each repair, past the usual limit of 39 levels.\nWhen it reaches the capacity of signed 32-bit integers, no repair cost is shown and the \"product\" item cannot be taken out of the anvil. Tools in this state also cannot be renamed or enchanted.\nAnvils are not damaged on use.\nSounds[edit | edit source]\nGeneric[edit | edit source]\nDespite being composed entirely of iron, anvils do not use iron sounds.[3]\nJava Edition:\n[hide]\nv t e\nanvil sound type\nSound Subtitles Source Description Resource location Translation key Volume Pitch Attenuation\ndistance\nBlock broken Blocks Once the block has broken block.anvil.break subtitles.block.generic.break 0.65 0.8 16\nBlock placed Blocks When the block is placed block.anvil.place subtitles.block.generic.place 0.65 0.8 16\nBlock breaking Blocks While the block is in the process of being broken block.anvil.hit subtitles.block.generic.hit 0.1625 0.5 16\nSomething falls on a block Entity-Dependent Falling on the block with fall damage block.anvil.fall subtitles.block.generic.fall 0.15 0.75 16\nFootsteps Entity-Dependent Walking on the block block.anvil.step subtitles.block.generic.footsteps 0.045 1.0 16\nBedrock Edition:\n[hide]\nv t e\nanvil sound type\nSound Source Description Resource location Volume Pitch\nBlocks Once the block has broken dig.stone 1.0 0.8-1.0\nBlocks When the block is placed random.anvil_land 0.5 0.8-1.0\nBlocks While the block is in the process of being broken hit.anvil 0.35 0.5\nPlayers Falling on the block with fall damage step.stone 0.4 1.0\nPlayers Walking on the block step.stone 0.6 1.0\nPlayers Jumping from the block step.stone 0.12 1.0\nPlayers Falling on the block without fall damage step.stone 0.22 1.0\nUnique[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition\n[hide]\nSounds\nSound Subtitles Source Description Resource location Translation key Volume Pitch Attenuation\ndistance\nAnvil destroyed Blocks When an anvil is destroyed block.anvil.destroy subtitles.block.anvil.destroy 1.0 0.9-1.0 16\nAnvil landed Blocks When an anvil lands and survives block.anvil.land subtitles.block.anvil.land 0.3 0.9-1.0 16\nAnvil used Blocks When an anvil is used block.anvil.use subtitles.block.anvil.use 1.0 0.9-1.0 16\nBedrock Edition:\n[hide]\nSounds\nSound Source Description Resource location Volume Pitch\nBlocks When an anvil is destroyed random.anvil_break 1.0 1.0\nBlocks When an anvil lands and survives random.anvil_land 0.5 0.8-1.0\nBlocks When an anvil is used and survives random.anvil_use 0.6 1.0\nData values[edit | edit source]\nID[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition:\nName Identifier Form Block tags Item tags\n[hide]\nTranslation key\nAnvil anvil Block & Item anvil anvil\nblock.minecraft.anvil\nChipped Anvil chipped_anvil Block & Item anvil anvil\nblock.minecraft.chipped_anvil\nDamaged Anvil damaged_anvil Block & Item anvil anvil\nblock.minecraft.damaged_anvil\nBedrock Edition:\nName Identifier Alias ID Numeric ID Form Item ID[i 1]\n[hide]\nTranslation key\nAnvil anvil anvil / 0 145 Block & Giveable Item[i 2] Identical[i 3]\ntile.anvil.intact.name\nChipped Anvil chipped_anvil anvil / 4 1214 Block & Giveable Item[i 2] Identical[i 3]\n(Numeric: -959)\ntile.anvil.slightlyDamaged.name\nDamaged Anvil damaged_anvil anvil / 8 1215 Block & Giveable Item[i 2] Identical[i 3]\n(Numeric: -960)\ntile.anvil.veryDamaged.name\nAnvil deprecated_anvil anvil / 12 1216 Block & Ungiveable Item[i 4] Identical[i 3]\n(Numeric: -961)\ntile.anvil.intact.name\n↑ ID of block's direct item form, which is used in savegame files and addons.\n↑\na b c Available with /give command.\n↑\na b c d The block's direct item form has the same ID as the block.\n↑ Unavailable with /give command\nBlock states[edit | edit source]\nSee also: Block states\nJava Edition:\nName Default value Allowed values\n[hide]\nDescription\nfacing north east\nnorth\nsouth\nwest An anvil pointing north or south is aligned with its long dimension pointing north–south.\nAn anvil pointing east or west is aligned with its long dimension pointing east–west.\nThis value is 90° clockwise from the direction a player faces while placing an anvil.\nBedrock Edition:\nName Metadata Bits Default value Allowed values Values for\nMetadata Bits\n[hide]\nDescription\nminecraft:cardinal_direction Not Supported south east\nnorth\nsouth\nwest Unsupported An anvil pointing north or south is aligned with its long dimension pointing north–south.\nAn anvil pointing east or west is aligned with its long dimension pointing east–west.\nThis value is 90° clockwise from the direction a player faces while placing an anvil.\nFalling block entity[edit | edit source]\nMain article: Falling Block\n[NBT Compound / JSON Object] Dynamic block entity data\nTags common to all entities[show]\n[NBT Compound / JSON Object] BlockState: The falling block represented by this entity.\n[String] Name: The resource location of the block.\n[NBT Compound / JSON Object] Properties: Optional.

By default this value is 2HP for anvils, and 6HP for pointed dripstone.\n[Int] FallHurtMax: The maximum hit points of damage to inflict on entities that intersect this falling block. For vanilla falling blocks, always 40HP × 20.\n[Byte] HurtEntities: 1 or 0 (true/false) – true if the block should hurt entities it falls on.

Harvesting an azalea with shears consumes the durability of the shears for no additional benefit.\nAn azalea also breaks if a piston extends or pushes a block into its location, or if water flows into it.\nBlock Azalea\nHardness 0\nBreaking time (secs)\nDefault 0.05\nOptions\nEfficiency\n0\nHaste\n0\nJE\nBE\nLegend\ndrops nothing\ndrops something other than the block itself\ndrops the block itself\nitalicized can be instant mined\nAxes are considered the preferred tool,[1] and swords would also increase the breaking speed,[2] however these ultimately have no impact due to the instant default mining speed.\nNatural generation[edit | edit source]\nAzaleas generate commonly on top of moss blocks in lush caves.\nPost-generation[edit | edit source]\nWhen decayed or mined with any tool except shears and tools enchanted with Silk Touch, azalea leaves have a 5% chance to drop azaleas. The Fortune enchantment increases the rate to 6.25% at level I, 8.33% at level II and 10% at level III.\nWhen using bone meal on a moss block, each block in a 3×3 to 7×7 area has a 15% chance of growing an azalea.\nUsage[edit | edit source]\nAzaleas can be placed on grass blocks, dirt, coarse dirt, rooted dirt, podzol, moss blocks, farmland, mud, muddy mangrove roots and clay.\nUnlike most transparent blocks, mobs can spawn on top of azaleas in Java Edition[3].\nComposting[edit | edit source]\nPutting an azalea in a composter has a 65% chance of increasing the composting level.\nFuel[edit | edit source]\nAzaleas can be used as a fuel source in furnaces, smelting 0.5 items per azalea.\nGrowing trees[edit | edit source]\nUnlike saplings, an azalea does not automatically grow into an azalea tree. Therefore, using bone meal on it is the only way to grow an azalea tree. Application of bone meal gives an azalea a 45% chance to grow into an azalea tree, provided there is a 3×5×3 area above it that is clear of all blocks that are not leaves or logs.\nSounds[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition:\n[hide]\nv t e\nazalea sound type\nSound Subtitles Source Description Resource location Translation key Volume Pitch Attenuation\ndistance\nBlock broken Blocks Once the block has broken block.azalea.break subtitles.block.generic.break 1.0 0.8 16\nBlock placed Blocks When the block is placed block.azalea.place subtitles.block.generic.place 1.0 0.8 16\nBlock breaking Blocks While the block is in the process of being broken block.azalea.hit subtitles.block.generic.hit 0.25 0.5 16\nSomething falls on a block Entity-Dependent Falling on the block with fall damage block.azalea.fall subtitles.block.generic.fall 0.5 0.75 16\nFootsteps Entity-Dependent Walking on the block block.azalea.step subtitles.block.generic.footsteps 0.15 1.0 16\nBedrock Edition:\n[hide]\nv t e\nazalea sound type\nSound Source Description Resource location Volume Pitch\nBlocks Once the block has broken break.azalea 1.0 0.8-1.0\nBlocks When the block is placed place.azalea 1.0 0.8-1.0\nBlocks While the block is in the process of being broken hit.azalea 0.35 0.5\nFriendly Creatures Falling on the block with fall damage fall.azalea 0.4 1.0\nFriendly Creatures Walking on the block step.azalea 0.17 1.0\nFriendly Creatures Jumping from the block jump.azalea 0.12 1.0\nFriendly Creatures Falling on the block without fall damage land.azalea 0.14 1.0\nData values[edit | edit source]\nID[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition:\nName Identifier Form\n[hide]\nTranslation key\nAzalea azalea Block & Item\nblock.minecraft.azalea\nBedrock Edition:\nName Identifier Numeric ID Form Item ID[i 1]\n[hide]\nTranslation key\nAzalea azalea 592 Block & Giveable Item[i 2] Identical[i 3]\ntile.azalea.name\n↑ ID of block's direct item form, which is used in savegame files and addons.\n↑ Available with /give command.\n↑ The block's direct item form has the same ID as the block.\nHistory[edit | edit source]\nOctober 3, 2020 Azaleas are announced as part of lush caves at Minecraft Live 2020.\n[hide]\nJava Edition\n1.17 21w05a Added azaleas.\n21w10a Azaleas now generate in lush caves.\n21w11a Azaleas can now be used as fuel in a furnace.\n21w13a The model of the azalea has been changed so that the texture of the sides is corrected and that the inner side texture is mirrored.\n21w16a Azaleas can now be fertilized with bone meal to get azalea trees.[4]\nPre-release 1 Azaleas can now be placed in flower pots.\n[hide]\nBedrock Edition\n1.16.220\nExperiment\nCaves and Cliffs beta 1.16.220.52 Added azaleas.\n1.17.0\nExperiment\nCaves and Cliffs beta 1.16.230.54 Azaleas can now be grown into an azalea tree when using bone meal.\nbeta 1.17.0.50 Azaleas are now affected by directional shading.\n1.17.0 beta 1.17.0.52 Azaleas are now available without enabling experimental gameplay.\n1.17.10 beta 1.17.10.21 Azaleas can now be placed in flower pots.\n1.18.30 beta 1.18.20.29 Mobs no longer spawn inside azaleas.[5]\nIssues[edit | edit source]\nIssues relating to \"Azalea\" are maintained on the bug tracker.

In Java Edition, they are also technically capable of growing in dripstone caves and deep dark biomes, though it is very unlikely due to lack of grass blocks in these biomes. In flower forests and meadows, azure bluets only generate as part of gradients.\nNatural azure bluets are found in plains villages. Potted azure bluets can also be generated in woodland mansions.\nPost-generation[edit | edit source]\nMain article: Flower § Post-generation\nJava Edition[edit | edit source]\nWhen bone meal is applied to a grass block in a plains, sunflower plains, flower forest, meadow, dripstone caves, or deep dark biome, azure bluets have a chance of generating on the targeted block and adjacent grass blocks in a 15×5×15 area. In meadows and flower forests, azure bluets can generate only in specific locations depending on the flower gradient. In plains, sunflower plains, dripstone caves, and the deep dark, azure bluets cannot generate in tulip-only areas.\nBedrock Edition[edit | edit source]\nWhen bone meal is applied to a grass block in a plains, sunflower plains, or flower forest biome, azure bluets have a chance of generating on the targeted block and adjacent grass blocks in a 7×5×7 area. In flower forests, azure bluets can generate only in specific locations depending on the flower gradient. In plains and sunflower plains, azure bluets cannot generate in tulip-only areas.\nWhen bone meal is applied to an azure bluet in any biome, more azure bluets appear on top of nearby grass blocks. The flowers can appear up to 3 blocks away from the original, forming a 7×7 square.\nMob loot[edit | edit source]\nIn Java Edition, endermen can pick up azure bluets, like any other one-block-tall flower, and drop it if killed while holding it.\nTrading[edit | edit source]\nWandering traders may sell an azure bluet for a single emerald.\nUsage[edit | edit source]\nMain article: Flower § Usage\nLike other flowers, azure bluets can be used as decoration and planted on grass blocks, dirt, coarse dirt, rooted dirt, farmland, podzol, mycelium, moss blocks, mud, or muddy mangrove roots.\nAzure bluets can also be placed in flower pots.\nCrafting ingredient[edit | edit source]\nName Ingredients\n[hide]\nCrafting recipe\nLight Gray Dye Azure Bluet\n\nSuspicious Stew Red Mushroom +\nBrown Mushroom +\nBowl +\nAzure Bluet\n\n\nSuspicious stew[edit | edit source]\nMain article: Suspicious Stew\nUsing an azure bluet to make suspicious stew, whether by direct crafting or by feeding a brown mooshroom and then milking it with a bowl, imbues it with a Blindness effect that lasts 11 seconds in Java Edition and 7 seconds in Bedrock Edition.\nIngredients\n[hide]\nCrafting recipe\nRed Mushroom +\nBrown Mushroom +\nBowl +\nAzure Bluet\n\n\nBees[edit | edit source]\nBees engage in a pollinating behavior with azure bluets, increasing the honey level in beehives and bee nests by 1.\nBreeding[edit | edit source]\nAzure bluets can be used to breed, grow, and lead bees.\nBee nests[edit | edit source]\nOak, birch, and cherry trees grown from saplings that are within 2 blocks of an azure bluet have a 5% chance to grow with a bee nest and 2-3 bees in it.\nComposting[edit | edit source]\nPlacing an azure bluet into a composter has a 65% chance of raising the compost level by 1.

In Bedrock Edition, they can be obtained through add-ons or inventory editing. In Java Edition, they do not exist as items and are thus completely unobtainable.\nBreaking[edit | edit source]\nBamboo stalks can be mined with any tool, but an axe is quicker than other tools. Using a sword of any type breaks bamboo stalks and shoots instantly, even with Mining Fatigue. Flowing water also breaks bamboo shoots, but not mature bamboo stalks.\nBlock Bamboo Bamboo Shoot\nHardness 1 1\nTool —\nBreaking time (sec)[A]\nDefault 1.5 1.5\nWooden 0.75 —\nStone 0.4 —\nIron 0.25 —\nDiamond 0.2 —\nNetherite 0.2 —\nGolden 0.15 —\nSword 0.05 0.05\nOptions\nEfficiency\n0\nHaste\n0\nJE\nBE\nLegend\ndrops nothing\ndrops something other than the block itself\ndrops the block itself\nitalicized can be instant mined\n↑ These durations ignore other influential factors (e.g. Mining Fatigue), and are measured in seconds. For more information, see Breaking § Speed.\n\nNatural generation[edit | edit source]\nMain article: Bamboo (feature)\nBamboo generates in widely scattered single shoots within jungle biomes. Bamboo generates much more densely in the bamboo variants of jungles, covering large areas of the landscape. Bamboo does not generate in sparse jungles.[1]\nMob loot[edit | edit source]\nIn Java Edition, a panda drops 1 bamboo when killed. Looting does not affect the drop rate.[2]\nIn Bedrock Edition, a panda drops 0-2 bamboo when killed. Looting increases the drop by 1 per level.\nSource Roll Chance Quantity (Roll Chance)\nDefault Looting I Looting II Looting III\nPanda(BE) 100% 0–2 0–3 0–4 0–5\nPanda(JE) 100% 1 1 1 1\nGenerated loot[edit | edit source]\nItem Structure Container Quantity\n[hide]\nChance\nJava Edition\nBamboo Jungle Pyramid Chest 1–3 51%\nShipwreck Supply chest 1–3 14.4%\nBedrock Edition\nBamboo Jungle Pyramid Chest 1–3 50.9%\nShipwreck Supply chest 1–3 14.4%\nFishing[edit | edit source]\nBamboo can be found while fishing in jungle biomes as a junk item.\nUsage[edit | edit source]\nWhen broken, any bamboo block placed or grown above it is also broken. A bamboo block drops itself as an item if a piston pushes it or moves a block into its space. When bamboo is first placed as a shoot it’s not solid and can be destroyed by water flowing into it. After growing at least one block taller it becomes a solid stalk and cannot be destroyed by water. To transform a bamboo shoot into a solid bamboo block place another bamboo on top of it.\nUnlike most plants, bamboo cannot be composted.[3]\nFarming[edit | edit source]\nBamboo can be planted on moss blocks, grass blocks, dirt, coarse dirt, rooted dirt, gravel, mycelium, podzol, sand, red sand, suspicious sand, suspicious gravel, mud, muddy mangrove roots, bamboo shoot, or on itself. At default random tick speed (3), each plant grows on average every 4096 game ticks (204.8 seconds). When bone meal is used on it, it grows by 1–2 blocks. Bamboo can grow up to 12–16 blocks tall. The top of a bamboo plant requires a light level of 9 or above to grow.\nBecause bamboo breaks in almost the same way as sugar canes, a sugar cane farm can be easily adapted to this use. While water is not needed with such a farm, some spacing is recommended if the harvest is done manually as mature stalks are solid.\nPandas[edit | edit source]\nBamboo items are eaten by pandas and can be used to speed up the growth of baby pandas. Bamboo can also be used to breed pandas when at least 1 bamboo block (not a bamboo shoot) is within 5 blocks of the pandas, making the panda the only animal in the game to have extra breeding requirements. At this point, the player can feed them bamboo and they mate to have a baby.\nFuel[edit | edit source]\nBamboo can be used as fuel for smelting. Each bamboo item smelts 0.25 items.\nBamboo can be crafted into other items to increase its fuel efficiency.\nBy crafting a Block of Bamboo (9 bamboo) into 2 bamboo planks, 3 items can be smelted instead of 2.25, a 33.3% increase in efficiency.\nIn Bedrock Edition, the fuel efficiency can be further doubled by crafting the bamboo planks into twice the amount of slabs.[4]\nFlower pots[edit | edit source]\nBamboo can be placed in a flower pot, where it retains the design it has in its item form.\nCrafting ingredient[edit | edit source]\nName Ingredients Crafting recipe\n[hide]\nDescription\nBlock of Bamboo Bamboo\n\nCannot be crafted back into 9 bamboo.\nScaffolding Bamboo +\nString\n\n6\nStick Bamboo\n\nAppearance[edit | edit source]\nThe different stages of bamboo growth.\nThe appearance of bamboo changes as it grows. When first placed, it takes the form of a small shoot that has no hitbox. When it grows one block taller its thickness increases to 2 pixels and the top block has leaves. At 3 blocks tall, the top two blocks have leaves. At 4 blocks tall, the bamboo thickness expands to 3×3 pixels. At 5 blocks tall, the top three blocks have leaves on them, and these blocks remain on top as the bamboo grows. Destroying a block of bamboo does not change the appearance of the blocks below it.

A banner can be customized with up to 6 layers of patterns. The top layer of a banner (or the last pattern added) can be washed off by using it on a cauldron containing water.\nBanners, much like signs, can be placed either on the ground facing in 16 directions, or on a wall. They gently sway as if affected by a breeze, regardless of dimension or location.\nOther blocks (including other banners) can be placed on any edge of a banner's hitbox, which is only one block high despite the banner appearing as two blocks tall. When a banner is placed on the side of a block, its position is set by the top block. This makes it possible to overlap another solid block on the top half of a floor banner, or the bottom half of a wall banner.\nBanners have no collision mask as they are completely non-solid, so entities can move through them.\nBanners cannot be moved by pistons.\nWater and lava flow around banners. In Bedrock Edition, banners can be waterlogged. Lava can create fire in air blocks next to banners as if the banners were flammable, but the banners do not burn (and cannot be burned by other methods).\nWater can be placed below wall banners\nWater flows around a banner on the ground\nPatterns[edit | edit source]\nSee also: List of patterned banners\nA banner may have up to six layers of patterns, which are overlaid with the last-added on top. Patterns can colored with any of the 16 dye colors.\nA loom is used to add patterns. All patterns require a dye, but some of them also need a banner pattern item, which is not consumed in the process.\nLoom recipes[show][edit]\nIn Bedrock Edition, most patterns can also be added through crafting, although this generally requires more dye and may also consume valuable items such as enchanted golden apples. Designs that require uncraftable banner pattern items (e.g. globe or gust) are not available through crafting.\nCrafting recipes[show][edit]\nCustom banner and shield designs can be preview using this tool:\nExample of a banner with more than 6 patterns, a result of using the /give command.\nIn Java Edition, a banner can have more than six layers of patterns if obtained through commands (such as /give or /setblock) or external editors. A banner can visually display up to 16 layers. The item tooltip of a banner with more than 6 patterns lists only the first 6 bottom-most layers. Here is an example of a command that gives the player a banner with eight different patterns:\n/give @s white_banner[banner_patterns=[{pattern:half_horizontal,color:red},{pattern:stripe_top,color:blue},{pattern:stripe_middle,color:pink},{pattern:stripe_bottom,color:cyan},{pattern:stripe_downright,color:yellow},{pattern:stripe_downleft,color:lime},{pattern:rhombus,color:orange},{pattern:skull,color:black}]]\nIn Bedrock Edition, banners with more than 6 layers are unobtainable via commands. Banners can display only up to 6 layers, even if more layers are added using external editors. Tooltips of such banners list all the layers.\nCrafting ingredient[edit | edit source]\nShields can have patterns applied to them using banners. The shield pattern has a smaller resolution than the banner pattern, causing them to look different or offset.\nIngredients Crafting recipe\n[hide]\nDescription\nShield +\nMatching Banner\n\n\nApplies the banner pattern to the shield. The banner is consumed.\nThe shield must have no preexisting patterns.\nDoes not change existing durability or enchantments on the shield.\nCopying[edit | edit source]\nBanners can be copied with a blank banner to make multiple identical banners. Banners with more than 6 patterns applied using commands cannot be copied in this manner.\nIngredients Crafting recipe\n[hide]\nDescription\nMatching Banner\n\n\nCopies pattern; both banners must have the same base color, and the one having a pattern copied onto it must have no preexisting pattern.\nRenaming[edit | edit source]\nLike other items, banners can be renamed on an anvil. A banner retains its custom name when it is placed and retrieved, when a layer is added or removed, and when the banner is cloned; additionally, applying a renamed banner to a shield in Bedrock Edition gives the shield the custom banner name.\nIn Java Edition, a banner can also be given a custom name by using the /data command on a banner block to change its CustomName NBT tag.\nMap marker[edit | edit source]\nHow every banner appears in Java Edition on a map, including a named banner.\nThis feature is exclusive to Java Edition. \nIn Java Edition, pressing the use control on a banner while holding a map places a marker of the banner's position on the selected map, and pressing use on the banner again removes the marker. The marker has the same color as the banner's base without decorations. The marker is removed if the banner is destroyed unless the map is locked using a cartography table. If the banner is renamed, the name appears below the marker.\nHelmet[edit | edit source]\nThis feature is exclusive to Java Edition. \nWhile a banner cannot be equipped in the head slot in Survival mode, equipping it using commands causes it to appear on top of the player. This is how raid captains wear banners.\nChestplate[edit | edit source]\nThis feature is exclusive to Bedrock Edition. \nWhile a banner cannot be equipped in the chestplate slot in Survival mode, equipping it using NBT editors causes it to appear on top of the player. This is how raid captains wear banners.\nFuel[edit | edit source]\nBanners can be used as a fuel in furnaces, smelting 1.5 items per banner.\nNote blocks[edit | edit source]\nBanners can be placed under note blocks to produce \"bass\" sounds.\nSounds[edit | edit source]\nGeneric[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition:\n[hide]\nv t e\nwood sound type\nSound Subtitles Source Description Resource

Issues should be reported and viewed there.\nTrivia[edit | edit source]\nWith 16 blank banners, 42 patterns of 16 colors each (608 uniquely-colored patterns), and 0 to 6 patterns per banner, the number of uniquely crafted banners is\n1\n6\n×\n∑\nk\n=\n0\n6\n(\n1\n6\n×\n4\n2\n)\nk\n=\n1\n,\n4\n7\n5\n,\n6\n4\n6\n,\n6\n4\n1\n,\n9\n4\n0\n,\n0\n9\n7\n,\n5\n5\n2\nor approximately 1.47 quintillion. The number of visually distinct banners is smaller, because one or more patterns may completely cover other patterns or be duplicated.\nA banner can have up to 16 layers of patterns with the use of commands. The total number of unique banners with at most 16 banner patterns is approximately 1.27 × 1046 (12.7 quattuordecillion), or exactly 12,696,344,039,844,551,126,101,565,750,244,757,433,489,827,856.\nThe Mojang logo is called \"Thing\" in-game, which could be considered an alternate translation for mojäng.\nIn the Swedish translation of the game, this pattern is, in fact, called mojäng.\nBanner textures are located in \\assets\\minecraft\\textures\\entity\\banner.\nThere are 40 monochrome textures, each containing all 6 sides of the banner.\nThe texture of the back side is the mirrored texture of the front side.\nCompared to the texture files, textures' colors are inverted in-game due to them acting as masks for the re-colored base texture, base.png. That means white is visible, while black is transparent.\nGallery[edit | edit source]\nRenders[edit | edit source]\nBanner[edit | edit source]\nWall banner[edit | edit source]\nScreenshots[edit | edit source]\nAnother banner image from Jeb.\nSeveral banners made by Searge.\nBanners in the official 1.8 poster.\nAn image, tweeted by Jeb, showcasing the changes he made to the banner color palette in the 1.12 update.\nThe result of using gradient different numbers of times, each time increasing the level of gradient by 1.\nAll positions and rotations of a banner\nA banner with the Mojang logo in an item frame.\nBanners floating outside of an end city tower.\nBanners hanging above the doorway of a woodland mansion master bedroom.\nBanner put in the helmet slot by using the command /replaceitem‌[BE only] or /item replace‌[JE only].\nBanners in Bedrock Edition.\nA banner in the hand.\nA banner in the inventory.\nA banner in the crafting grid.\nA banner being given a pattern.\nDevelopment images[edit | edit source]\nThe first image of banners, as tweeted by Jens Bergensten.\nIn other media[edit | edit source]\nLEGO banners from 21127 and 21131\nLEGO banner from 21138\nLEGO banner from 21142\nLEGO banner from 21144\nAnother LEGO banner from 21144\nA third LEGO banner from 21144\nLEGO banner from 21152\nLEGO banners from 21155\nNavigation[edit | edit source]\n[hide]\nv t e\nBlocks\n[show]\nStructural\n[show]\nOrnamental\n[show]\nNatural\n[hide]\nUtility\nInteractable Anvil Chipped Damaged Barrel Beacon Brewing Stand Cartography Table Chest Ender Crafting Table Enchanting Table Furnace Blast Smoker Grindstone Lectern Loom Shulker Box Dyed Sign Hanging Smithing Table Stonecutter\nUtilizable Banners Ominous Beehive Beds Bell Cake with Candle Campfire Soul Cauldron Lava Powder Snow Water Chiseled Bookshelf Composter Conduit Decorated Pot End Gateway End Portal End Portal Frame Farmland Fletching Table Flower Pot Frosted Ice Heads Skeleton Wither Skeleton Zombie Creeper Piglin Dragon Heavy Core Jukebox Ladder Lodestone Monster Spawner Nether Portal Respawn Anchor Scaffolding Sponge Wet Suspicious Gravel Suspicious Sand TNT Trial Spawner Ominous Vault Ominous\nRedstone/Mechanical Buttons Wooden Stone Polished Blackstone Copper Bulb Crafter Daylight Detector Dispenser Dropper Doors Copper Iron Wooden Honey Block Hopper Lever Lightning Rod Note Block Observer Piston Sticky Head Moving Pressure Plates Wooden Stone Polished Blackstone Heavy Weighted Light Weighted Rail Activator Detector Powered Redstone Lamp Redstone Wire Comparator Repeater Torch Slime Block Target Trapped Chest Trapdoors Copper Iron Wooden Fence Gates Tripwire Hook Tripwire\nMinecraft Education only Chalkboard\nBE & edu only Allow Border Compound Creator Deny Element Constructor Heat Block Item Frame Glow Lab Table Material Reducer Underwater TNT Underwater Torch\n[show]\nCreative or commands only\n[show]\nUnused\n[show]\nUnimplemented\n[show]\nJoke features\n[show]\nRemoved",

Up to 3 barrels can generate in a village fisher cottage.

Lava can create fire in air blocks next to barrels as if the barrel was flammable, but the barrel does not actually catch fire and can't be burned.\nContainer[edit | edit source]\nThe GUI of the barrel.\nBarrels have a container inventory with 27 slots, which is the same as a single chest. Unlike chests, a barrel can be placed below a solid block and still be able to be opened. They can be filled by droppers and both filled and emptied by hoppers. When broken, barrels drop the contents of the container and the barrel item itself.\nTo open the barrel interface, use the Use Item control. To move items between the barrel inventory and the player inventory or hotbar while the barrel interface is open, drag or shift-click the items. Holding Shift and double-clicking while holding an item moves all items of the type clicked on in or out of the barrel to the extent that space is available for them.‌[Java Edition only] To exit the barrel interface, use the Esc control.\nBy default, the interface of a barrel is labeled \"Barrel\". A barrel's GUI label can be changed by naming the barrel in an anvil before placing it or by using the /data command‌[Java Edition only] (for example, to label a barrel at (0,64,0) as \"Bonus Barrel!\", use /data merge block 0 64 0 {CustomName:'\"Bonus Barrel!\"'}).\nIn Java Edition, a barrel can be \"locked\" by setting its Lock tag using the /data command. If a barrel's Lock tag is not blank, the barrel cannot be opened unless the player is holding an item with the same name as the Lock tag's text. For example, to lock a barrel at (0,64,0) so that the barrel cannot be opened unless the player is holding an item named \"Barrel Key\", use /data merge block 0 64 0 {Lock:\"Barrel Key\"}.\nProfession[edit | edit source]\nMain article: Job site block\nIf a barrel has not been claimed by a villager, any nearby unemployed villager has a chance to change their profession to fisherman and claim the barrel as their job site block.\nFuel[edit | edit source]\nBarrels can be used as a fuel in furnaces, smelting 1.5 items per block.\nNote Blocks[edit | edit source]\nBarrels can be placed under note blocks to produce \"bass\" sounds.\nPiglins[edit | edit source]\nPiglins become hostile toward players who open or break barrels.\nSounds[edit | edit source]\nGeneric[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition:\n[hide]\nv t e\nwood sound type\nSound Subtitles Source Description Resource location Translation key Volume Pitch Attenuation\ndistance\nBlock broken Blocks Once the block has broken block.wood.break subtitles.block.generic.break 1.0 0.8 16\nBlock placed Blocks When the block is placed block.wood.place subtitles.block.generic.place 1.0 0.8 16\nBlock breaking Blocks While the block is in the process of being broken block.wood.hit subtitles.block.generic.hit 0.25 0.5 16\nSomething falls on a block Entity-Dependent Falling on the block with fall damage block.wood.fall subtitles.block.generic.fall 0.5 0.75 16\nFootsteps Entity-Dependent Walking on the block block.wood.step subtitles.block.generic.footsteps 0.15 1.0 16\nBedrock Edition:\n[hide]\nv t e\nwood sound type\nSound Source Description Resource location Volume Pitch\nBlocks Once the block has broken dig.wood 1.0 0.8-1.0\nBlocks When the block is placed dig.wood 1.0 0.8\nBlocks While the block is in the process of being broken hit.wood 0.23 0.5\nPlayers Falling on the block with fall damage fall.wood 0.4 1.0\nPlayers Walking on the block step.wood 0.3 1.0\nBlocks Jumping from the block jump.wood 0.12 1.0\nBlocks Falling on the block without fall damage land.wood 0.18 1.0\nUnique[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition\n[hide]\nSounds\nSound Subtitles Source Description Resource location Translation key Volume Pitch Attenuation\ndistance\nBarrel closes Blocks When a barrel closes block.barrel.close subtitles.block.barrel.close 0.5 0.9-1.0 16\nBarrel opens Blocks When a barrel opens block.barrel.open subtitles.block.barrel.open 0.5 0.9-1.0 16\nFisherman works Friendly Creatures Randomly while a fisherman is working entity.villager.work_fisherman subtitles.entity.villager.work_fisherman 1.0 0.8-1.2 16\nChest locked[sound 1] Blocks When a player attempts to open a barrel locked using the [String] Lock tag block.chest.locked[sound 1] subtitles.block.chest.locked[sound 1] 1.0 1.0 16\n↑\na b c MC-98316 — Wrong subtitles caused by missing distinction\nBedrock Edition:\n[hide]\nSounds\nSound Source Description Resource location Volume Pitch\nBlocks When a barrel closes block.barrel.close 1.0 1.0\nBlocks When a barrel opens block.barrel.open 1.0 1.0\nBlocks Randomly while a fisherman is working block.barrel.open 1.0 1.0\nData values[edit | edit source]\nID[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition:\nName Identifier Form Block tags\n[hide]\nTranslation key\nBarrel barrel Block & Item guarded_by_piglins\nblock.minecraft.barrel\nName\n[hide]\nIdentifier\nBlock entity barrel\nBedrock Edition:\nName Identifier Numeric ID Form Item ID[i 1]\n[hide]\nTranslation key\nBarrel barrel 458 Block & Giveable Item[i 2] Identical[i 3]\ntile.barrel.name\n↑ ID of block's direct item form, which is used in savegame files and addons.\n↑ Available with /give command.\n↑ The block's direct item form has the same ID as the block.\nName\n[hide]\nSavegame ID\nBlock entity Barrel\nBlock states[edit | edit source]\nSee also: Block states\nJava Edition:\nName Default value Allowed values\n[hide]\nDescription\nfacing north down\neast\nnorth\nsouth\nup\nwest The direction the barrel is facing.\nopen false false\ntrue Whether the barrel is currently being looked at by a player; changes the texture on the top face.\nBedrock Edition:\nName Metadata Bits Default value Allowed values Values for\nMetadata Bits\n[hide]\nDescription\nfacing_direction 0x1\n0x2\n0x4 0 0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5 0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5 The direction the barrel is facing.\n0:Down facing barrel\n1:Up facing barrel\n2:East facing barrel\n3:West facing barrel\n4:South facing barrel\n5:North facing barrel\nopen_bit 0x8 0 0\n1 0\n1 Whether the barrel is currently being looked at by a player; changes the texture on the top face.\n\nBlock data[edit | edit source]\nA barrel has a block entity associated with it that holds additional data about the block.\nJava Edition:\nSee also: Block entity format\n[NBT Compound / JSON Object] Block entity data\nTags common to all block entities[show]\n[String] CustomName: Optional.

In Java Edition, they generate as the floor in debug mode worlds.\nUsage[edit | edit source]\nThe difference between air (top left) and barriers (bottom left) when \"show invisible blocks\" is enabled.\nBarrier blocks are mainly used to build an impenetrable barrier that cannot be broken in standard Survival mode. For example, they can be used to protect a reserved area from entry by players, mobs, and other entities. Unlike other kinds of unbreakable blocks that could be used for this purpose (such as bedrock), barrier blocks are unobtrusive because they are invisible. Barrier blocks cannot be destroyed by TNT, creeper explosions, or any other explosions. Furthermore, they have a greater amount of blast resistance than any other unbreakable block.\nUnlike other operator blocks such as command blocks, barriers can be placed by players in Survival mode.\nIn the player's inventory, the block is displayed as a red box with a slash through it, but when placed it is completely invisible.\nBarriers are transparent to light and do not block beacons. Fences, iron bars, glass panes, and similar blocks do not visually connect with barriers. Barriers interact with blocks and mobs as a solid block. All dependent blocks can be placed on a barrier, such as torches or redstone, and it can suffocate mobs. Mobs cannot spawn on barriers.\nIn Creative mode, if a player is holding a barrier block in their hand, all placed barrier blocks display the barrier icon as a particle. This effect is client-side, and if a player holds a barrier block in Survival mode, the particle does not appear. Barrier blocks are not shown if the particle setting is set to \"minimal\".\nWaterlogging[edit | edit source]\nBarrier blocks can be waterlogged by being placed into a water source block or by manually using a water bucket on them. In Java Edition, water cannot be placed in them or taken out by non-direct interactions such as dispensers; this is allowed in Bedrock Edition. In Java Edition, only players in Creative mode can waterlog or remove water from barriers, while in Bedrock Edition there are no game mode restrictions. In Java Edition, water does not flow out of waterlogged barriers. See waterlogging for more details on what blocks can be waterlogged.\nPiston interactivity[edit | edit source]\nBarriers cannot be pushed by pistons.

They also generate in the basalt deltas biome as regular terrain and as part of basalt columns. In Java Edition, they also generate in blobs, which attempt to replace netherrack 75 times per chunk in blobs of radius 3—7, from levels 0 to 127, in basalt deltas biomes.\nBasalt can also be found naturally as part of bastion remnants.\nPost-generation[edit | edit source]\nA simple basalt generator.\nBasalt can also be made by lava flowing into a space that is on top of soul soil and adjacent to blue ice. The flowing lava is then replaced with basalt.\nUsage[edit | edit source]\nBasalt's only current use is as building material.

A mixture of blocks of different types can also be used in any orientation, so long as they form a pyramid structure, like the ones listed below.\nStatus effect range can be improved by increasing the pyramid power level (see chart below). At level 4, the pyramid gives the option to increase the primary effect's strength to Level II in the beacon's GUI.\nPyramids[edit | edit source]\nFor other pyramid structures, see Pyramid.\nThe four possible pyramid arrangements when using the beacon block. From left to right the pyramid structures decrease in complexity and strength.\nPyramids are the structures required to activate beacons. There are four possible pyramid heights. More pyramid levels make more powers available in a wider affected vicinity. The type of mineral block used to build the pyramid is entirely cosmetic and has no functional effect. Several different block types can be mixed without affecting functionality. If the pyramid is damaged so that the beacon deactivates, the previously-set powers resume their effects upon reactivation when the pyramid is repaired. This applies to piston-altered pyramids as well.\nA single beacon pyramid\nLevel Mineral blocks Materials Layers\n1 9 81 (1 stack + 17 items) 3×3, beacon\n2 34 306 (4 stacks + 50 items) 5×5, 3×3, beacon\n3 83 (1 stack + 19 blocks) 747 (11 stacks + 43 items) 7×7, 5×5, 3×3, beacon\n4 164 (2 stacks + 36 blocks) 1476 (23 stacks + 4 items) 9×9, 7×7, 5×5, 3×3, beacon\nThis six-beacon pyramid provides all six effects from a single structure using the fewest mineral blocks possible.\nMultiple beacons can make use of the same specific mineral blocks below them. Combined pyramids do not need to be symmetrical. The image to the right shows a 6-beacon (2 by 3) pyramid. It requires a total of 244 mineral blocks, with a base layer of 10 by 11.\nMultiple beacons pyramid (tier 4 can enable all buffs)\nLevel Mineral blocks Materials Layers\n1 20 180 (2 stacks + 52 items) 4×5, beacons\n2 62 558 (8 stacks + 46 items) 6×7, 4×5, beacons\n3 134 (2 stacks + 6 blocks) 1206 (18 stacks + 54 items) 8×9, 6×7, 4×5, beacons\n4 244 (3 stacks + 52 blocks) 2196 (34 stacks + 20 items) 10×11, 8×9, 6×7, 4×5, beacons\nBeam[edit | edit source]\nA vertical beam appears from a beacon if the beacon is activated, extending from the beacon block up to beyond the top of the world.\nIn Java Edition, the beam is visible up to 1343 blocks away.\nIn Bedrock Edition, the beam is visible up to 64 blocks away, regardless of how high the render distance is set.[1]\nColors[edit | edit source]\nThe color of the beam may be changed by placing blocks of stained glass or stained glass panes anywhere above the beacon block. The beam changes colors according to the colors of glass placed above it: the first block sets the beam color, while each additional block sets the color by averaging the red, green, and blue components of the current beam color and the block's color. The color values are the same as those for the corresponding dye. This also works using hardened stained glass and hardened stained glass panes.‌[Bedrock Edition and Minecraft Education only] Stained glass panes have the same effect on the beam as stained glass blocks.\nThe resulting beam color can be found as\nC\n→\n=\n1\n2\nn\n(\nc\n0\n→\n+\n∑\ni\n=\n1\nn\n2\ni\n−\n1\nc\ni\n→\n)\nwhere\nc\ni\n→\nis the sequence of glass colors (\nc\n0\n→\ncorresponds to the lowest block and\nc\nn\n→\nto the highest one).\nBeacon beams cannot go through most blocks, but can go through bedrock (to allow beacons to be used in the Nether) and end portal frames.\nPowers[edit | edit source]\nSee also: Effect\nThe GUI shown when pressing use on the block.\nOnce the beacon is emitting a beam, it can then be fed one iron ingot, gold ingot, emerald, diamond, or netherite ingot to select the status effects given to players within range of the beacon. This is done through the beacon's GUI, displayed by pressing use while looking at the beacon block. It doesn't matter which of the items is fed into the beacon.\nIn the GUI, the player places the item to be fed in the empty slot and clicks an effect from the \"Primary Power\" section on the left. If the beacon is sitting on a 4-level pyramid, the \"Secondary Power\" section on the right also becomes active. The player can then choose either to turn on the Regeneration power in addition to the Primary Power or to raise the primary power to Level II. The user clicks the \"Done\" button (green checkmark), the item is consumed, and the power(s) become activated, with the outline of the effect on the HUD having a blue outline.‌[JE only] To change the beacon's powers, this process must be followed again, consuming another ingot or gem.\nIf the pyramid is broken, effects deactivate or weaken depending on the level of the pyramid that is no longer complete. Upon restoration of the pyramid, the originally selected power returns without the need to spend another item. If a smaller pyramid is upgraded the effect range increases to that of the new pyramid without the need of reactivating it, upgrading to level 4 does not modify effect power.\nThe five primary powers are:\nSpeed I: Increased movement speed.\nHaste I: Increased mining and attack speed.\nResistance I: Decreased nearly all incoming damage (2-level pyramid required).\nJump Boost I: Increased jumping distance and height (2-level pyramid required).\nStrength I: Increased melee damage (3-level pyramid required).\nThe secondary powers available with a 4-level pyramid are:\nRegeneration I: Regenerates health.\nIncreasing the primary power to level II.\nIt is also possible to combine two different primary Level I powers:‌[Java Edition only]\nselect a primary power in the left panel\nselect the Level II option in the right panel\nselect the second desired power back in the left panel\nOnly one of the two powers appear to be selected, although both effects are active.[2]\nEvery four seconds, the selected powers are applied with a duration of 9 seconds, plus 2 seconds per pyramid level, to all players in range. Thus, when powers are changed or a player travels outside the area-of-effect, the powers persist for 5–9 seconds, or 13-17 seconds with a full pyramid.\nRange[edit | edit source]\nThe beacon affects an area in the shape of a square column, which reaches downward and out to each side at a range determined by the size of the pyramid base (see table below), and upward a distance of that range + the height of this dimension blocks.\nThe effect duration from the beacon is also determined by the size of the pyramid base (9 + Pyramid size * 2).\nThe range of the beacon effect is limited by the simulation distance. As such, on simulation distance of 4 with a level 4 pyramid, the effect does not reach the chunks on the corners of the beacon range.\nThe distance from the player to the beacon block does not affect the intensity of the status effect.\nPyramid size Effect radius\n(blocks) Effect duration\n(seconds)\n1 level 20 11\n2 levels 30 13\n3 levels 40 15\n4 levels 50 17\nLight source[edit | edit source]\nBeacon blocks can function as light sources, emitting a light level 15. Like other light sources, they melt snow and ice. A beacon produces this light even when it doesn't emit a beam.\nPiston interactivity[edit | edit source]\nBeacons cannot be pushed nor pulled by pistons or sticky pistons.\nSounds[edit | edit source]\nGeneric[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition:\n[hide]\nv t e\nstone sound type\nSound Subtitles Source Description Resource location Translation key Volume Pitch Attenuation\ndistance\nBlock broken Blocks Once the block has broken block.stone.break subtitles.block.generic.break 1.0 0.8 16\nBlock placed Blocks When the block is placed block.stone.place subtitles.block.generic.place 1.0 0.8 16\nBlock breaking Blocks While the block is in the process of being broken block.stone.hit subtitles.block.generic.hit 0.25 0.5 16\nSomething falls on a block Entity-Dependent Falling on the block with fall damage block.stone.fall subtitles.block.generic.fall 0.5 0.75 16\nFootsteps Entity-Dependent Walking on the block block.stone.step subtitles.block.generic.footsteps 0.15 1.0 16\nBedrock Edition:\n[hide]\nv t e\nglass sound type\nSound Source Description Resource location Volume Pitch\nBlocks Once the block has broken random.glass 1.0 0.8-1.0\nBlocks When the block is placed dig.stone 1.0 0.8-1.0\nBlocks While the block is in the process of being broken hit.stone 0.4 0.6\nPlayers Falling on the block with fall damage fall.stone 0.4 1.0\nPlayers Walking on the block step.stone 0.3 1.0\nBlocks Jumping from the block jump.stone 0.12 1.0\nBlocks Falling on the block without fall damage land.stone 0.22 1.0\nUnique[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition:\n[hide]\nSounds\nSound Subtitles Source Description Resource location Translation key Volume Pitch Attenuation\ndistance\nBeacon activates Blocks When a beacon activates block.beacon.activate subtitles.block.beacon.activate 1.0 1.0 16\nBeacon hums Blocks Randomly while active block.beacon.ambient subtitles.block.beacon.ambient 0.9 1.0 7\nBeacon deactivates Blocks When a beacon turns off or is broken[sound 1] block.beacon.deactivate subtitles.block.beacon.deactivate 1.0 1.0 16\nBeacon power selected Blocks When a beacon's power is switched block.beacon.power_select subtitles.block.beacon.power_select 1.0 1.0 16\nChest locked[sound 2] Blocks When a player attempts to open a beacon locked using the [String] Lock tag block.chest.locked[sound 2] subtitles.block.chest.locked[sound 2] 1.0 1.0 16\n↑ MC-153086 — Beacons always play deactivating sound when broken, even when not powered\n↑\na b c MC-98316 — Wrong subtitles caused by missing distinction\nBedrock Edition:\n[hide]\nSounds\nSound Source Description Resource location Volume Pitch\nBlocks When a beacon activates beacon.activate 1.0 1.0\nBlocks Randomly while active beacon.ambient 1.0 1.0\nBlocks When a beacon turns off beacon.deactivate 1.0 1.0\nBlocks When a beacon's power is switched beacon.power 1.0 1.0\nData values[edit | edit source]\nID[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition:\nName Identifier Form\n[hide]\nTranslation key\nBeacon beacon Block & Item\nblock.minecraft.beacon\nName\n[hide]\nIdentifier\nBlock entity beacon\nBedrock Edition:\nName Identifier Numeric ID Form Item ID[i 1]\n[hide]\nTranslation key\nBeacon beacon 138 Block & Giveable Item[i 2] Identical[i 3]\ntile.beacon.name\n↑ ID of block's direct item form, which is used in savegame files and addons.\n↑ Available with /give command.\n↑ The block's direct item form has the same ID as the block.\nName\n[hide]\nSavegame ID\nBlock entity Beacon\nBlock data[edit | edit source]\nA beacon has a block entity associated with it that holds additional data about the block.\nJava Edition:\nSee also: Block entity format\n[NBT Compound / JSON Object] Block entity data\nTags common to all block entities[show]\n[String] CustomName: Optional.

Players can sleep during a thunderstorm even if they are in a biome where it does not rain (i.e. desert). Attempting to use a bed at any other time results in the message \"You can sleep only at night or during thunderstorms\" in Java Edition or \"You can only sleep at night and during thunderstorms\" in Bedrock Edition. A player sleeps in a bed for 101 in-game ticks, or 5.05 seconds before the time skips to the next day. Sleeping in a bed with the /gamerule doDaylightCycle set to false results in the player being kicked out of the bed after the 101 ticks, but does not change time of the world to day.\nSleeping in a bed is possible only in the Overworld. Attempting to sleep in a bed in the Nether, the End, and custom dimensions in which they are disabled causes it to explode and set fire to surrounding blocks.[2] The explosion has power 5, which is stronger than TNT (4), but not as strong as a charged creeper or end crystal (6). The explosion centers on the head part of the bed. Villagers can sleep normally in any dimension without the bed being blown up.[3] Upon death from a bed explosion, the message \"(Player) was killed by [Intentional Game Design]\" appears. In Bedrock Edition, bed explosions can be disabled by setting /gamerule respawnBlocksExplode to false; this still prevents beds to be used in invalid dimensions.\nThe player must be close to the bed to sleep. If the player is close enough to interact with the bed, but not close enough to sleep in it, the message \"You may not rest now, the bed is too far away\" in Java Edition or \"Bed is too far away\" in Bedrock Edition appears. To use a bed, a player must be within a distance of 3 blocks in Java Edition or 2 blocks in Bedrock Edition from the bed.\nIf a \"monster\" is within 8 blocks of the bed head horizontally (in the X- and Z-axis), and 5 blocks vertically (in the Y-axis), the message \"You may not rest now, there are monsters nearby\" appears and the player is prevented from sleeping until the monsters leave or are killed. Most hostile mobs, as well as some neutral mobs prevent players from sleeping, as shown in the table below.\nMob\nCollapse\nPrevent the player from sleeping \nBlaze Yes\nBogged, Skeleton, Stray, Wither Skeleton Yes\nBreeze Yes\nCreaking Yes\nCreeper Yes\nDrowned Yes\nEndermite Yes\nEnderman When hostile\nEnder Dragon No\nEvoker Yes\nGhast No\nGiant Yes\nGuardian, Elder Guardian Yes\nHoglin No\nIllusioner Yes\nKiller Bunny No\nMagma Cube No‌[JE only]/Yes‌[BE only]\nPiglin Yes‌[JE only]/No‌[BE only]\nPiglin Brute Yes‌[JE only]/No‌[BE only]\nPillager Yes\nPhantom Yes\nRavager Yes\nShulker No\nSilverfish Yes\nSkeleton Horse, Zombie Horse No‌[JE only]/Yes‌[BE only][4]\nSpider, Cave Spider Yes\nSlime No‌[JE only]/Yes‌[BE only]\nVex Yes\nVindicator Yes\nWarden Yes\nWitch Yes\nWither Yes\nZoglin Yes\nZombie, Zombie Villager, Husk Yes\nZombified Piglin When hostile‌[JE only]/Yes‌[BE only]\n\nIf the player has not entered a bed and didn't die for 3 in-game days, phantoms can spawn unless /gamerule doInsomnia is set to false. In Java Edition, this can be verified by checking if the \"Time Since Last Rest\" statistic is greater than 1.00 h.\nTaking damage from any source while in a bed causes the player to wake; this means players cannot sleep while on fire, while poisoned, or while starving, because the damage wakes them before they can fully fall asleep. Attacks from other players and hostile mobs also wake the player in this way, although the latter is rarely seen due to hostile mobs typically preventing the bed from being entered in the first place.\nThe player also cannot sleep in a bed occupied by another player, resulting in the message, \"This bed is occupied\".\nA player can, however, sleep in a bed being used by a villager. The player may first wake the villager (pressing use on the villager) and then quickly enter the bed before the villager can lie down again. The villager reclaims the bed after the player wakes. The villager is kicked out of its bed when a player attempts to sleep there.\nIf all sleeping requirements are met and the player enters a bed, the player is positioned in the bed. The player falls asleep as the screen fades to black. In Bedrock Edition, the sleeping animation slowly lowers the player into bed.\nOnce all players in a world are asleep, after 5 seconds (100 ticks) the time of day changes to sunrise. (time 0)\nDuring this time, the chat window is focused, and the player can leave the bed by clicking the Leave Bed button.\nWaterlogged beds‌[Bedrock Edition only] cannot be slept in unless the player or villager has the Water Breathing or Conduit Power status effects. Attempting to use a waterlogged bed otherwise does not display any message.[5]\nBeds displaying an error above the hotbar is a feature exclusive to beds; other blocks that cannot be used do not display such a message.[6]\nThe process for determining where to put the player after waking up is the same as for determining where to respawn the player after death (see below). The player attempting to sleep in a bed with no suitable wakeup positions (achievable by interacting with the bed from underneath it), such that the player will suffocate upon waking up, will result in the message \"This bed is obstructed\". The player always wakes up facing the head of the bed.\nVillagers always wake up on top of the bed, meaning they can suffocate if there isn't enough room above the bed.\nPassing the night[edit | edit source]\nSleeping changes the time of day to sunrise and resets the weather cycle, changing the weather to clear conditions. In Java Edition, the weather cycle resets only during rainy or snowy weather.\nSleeping does not accelerate processes that take place over time such as the growth of crops or smelting. If /gamerule doDaylightCycle is false, the player instead wakes up in the night.\nTo skip the night in multiplayer, all players in the Overworld must be in bed at the same time. Pressing the Leave Bed button is not necessary in this case. The percentage of players that need to sleep to skip the night can be customized with the game rule playersSleepingPercentage.\nVillagers are unable to skip the night by sleeping in beds, unlike players.\nPlayers and villagers do not drown or take damage from lava while in a bed, even if the bed is covered in lava. However, if the bed is destroyed while the player is in it, due to for example an explosion or by another player, the player wakes prematurely and the night does not pass.\nSetting the spawn point[edit | edit source]\nOnce a player has entered a bed (or right clicked the bed during daytime), their spawn point is set to the location of that bed. Multiple players can set their spawn point on a single bed.\nUsing a bed in the daytime likewise sets the spawn point, without actually entering the bed.\nWhen a bed explodes, it does not set the spawn point.\nThe message \"Respawn point set\" is displayed in chat when the respawn point is successfully changed.\nThe check for a bed is made only when the player respawns. This means that the bed can be destroyed and replaced or even reoriented, but as long as there is a bed present in the same location, the player can respawn there. If a player's bed is absent, or if the area around the bed is made unsuitable for respawning (see below), a message is displayed saying \"You have no home bed or respawn anchor, or it was obstructed\" in Java Edition or \"Your home bed was missing or obstructed\" in Bedrock Edition, and the player respawns at the world spawn point.\nWhen choosing where to respawn the player, the two blocks to the immediate left and right of the head of the bed are considered first. Which block is chosen between the two corresponds to which direction the player was facing when they last interacted with the bed to set their spawn point; For example, a bed facing west will respawn the player on the south side of the bed if they are facing towards the north while setting their spawn point, and vice versa. If the player is perfectly aligned with the bed when the spawn point is set, the right side of the bed takes priority. Interacting with the bed again will still update which side of the bed is chosen for respawning, even if the location of the spawn point itself does not change.\nOnce a side is chosen, if the block immediately on the chosen side of the head of the bed is obstructed, the next block to be checked is chosen moving in a clockwise (right side) or counterclockwise (left side) direction around the bed. If all of the 10 blocks immediately adjacent to the bed are obstructed, the block above the head of the bed is checked, followed by the block above the foot of the bed. The player is always respawned facing the head of the bed, the same as for waking up.\nFor a location to be unobstructed, the block at the level of the bed must be air or non-solid (e.g. torches, but not glass) and there must be a space with a solid block below it and two non-colliding blocks for the player to stand in 0-2 blocks below the bed. It does not matter if the bed itself has blocks above it. Putting a slab one block above a bed can act as a two block tall space, as the bed is half a block tall. The bed never spawns the player directly below itself even if all other locations are obstructed. If a bed is obstructed, the player's spawn point is cleared after they respawn. That is, even if the bed is subsequently made usable again, the player continues to respawn at the world spawn until interacting with the bed again.\nSpecifically, when interacting with it, the location of the head of the bed is saved as the spawn point, and if a bed is in that space (whether it is the foot or the head) then the respawn works. This can be observed by reorienting the bed with its head in the same location. Interacting with it does not produce a \"Respawn point set\" message as the game doesn't change the saved spawn point. If a bed is reoriented so that its foot is in this space, it still functions on the next respawn, but it can also be interacted with to update the spawn point to the new head of the bed and cause a \"Respawn point set\" message. Attempting the reverse, reorienting the bed so that it overlaps the original location of the foot, results in a respawn at world spawn. However, the location of the foot of the bed is also saved. If the bed is moved so that part of it overlaps the original location of the head, it can be observed that the same locations need to be obstructed to stop spawning. It is possible to respawn 2 blocks away from the bed this way.\nBouncing[edit | edit source]\nFalling onto a bed bounces the player with 66% strength – the bouncing-up velocity is 66% of the impact velocity. The player also takes less fall damage when bouncing on a bed. The player's fall distance is set to 50% of the actual distance fallen, which usually results in the player taking less than half of the normal fall damage.\nBaby villagers bounce on beds during the day.\nIf the player is falling while sleeping requirements are met, and presses use on a bed within reach before hitting the ground, the fall damage is delayed until the player wakes.\nA player can bounce on a bed while another player or villager is sleeping on it without waking the player or the villager up.\nVillagers can be pushed onto beds, as the bed is half a block tall.\nCuring[edit | edit source]\nEach bed in the vicinity of a zombie villager has a chance to speed up the process of curing the zombie villager. Iron bars (such as in a prison cell) also have this effect.\nPlacement[edit | edit source]\nBeds require two blocks of floor space. Placement requires at least 2 blocks from the player's facing direction. When placed, the foot of the bed is placed on the block selected and the head of the bed on the block farther away from the player. In Bedrock Edition, beds require solid blocks below them when placed. However, the bed remains in place if its supporting blocks are later removed. In Java Edition, beds do not require supporting blocks and can be placed anywhere, provided there is enough room.\nExplosions[edit | edit source]\nSee also: Tutorials/Ancient Debris § The bed method and Tutorials/Defeating the ender dragon § Beds\nBecause beds explode in the Nether and the End, they can be used as any other explosion, to demolish blocks or deal damage. Explosions can be used, for example, to mine for ancient debris or to kill the ender dragon.\nIn Bedrock Edition, beds do not explode if /gamerule respawnBlocksExplode is set to false.\nSounds[edit |

Issues should be reported and viewed there.\nTrivia[edit | edit source]\nThe reason beds explode in the Nether and the End is because Notch found it was the easiest solution to dimension-unique respawning.[16]\nDimension-unique respawning was eventually implemented via the respawn anchor, and gained command support at the same time. Despite this, beds and respawn anchors still explode in invalid dimensions.\nIf the player quits the game while sleeping, upon return the player wakes up beside the bed.\nUsing the /teleport command while another player is sleeping still teleports the sleeping player, but the player wakes immediately.‌[Java Edition only]\nIf the player places a bed on ice, running over the bed acts like running over ice, similar to slabs.\nWhen placed using the /setblock command, only one half of a bed is placed, because beds are two blocks long. A single half can be slept in like a whole bed.\nVillagers can sleep in the Nether and the End without causing the bed to explode.[17]\nWhile the block state used to determine the half of a two-block block such as doors and double-tall flowers is called half, in the case of beds this is called part.\nThe red bed was the original default bed color. In Java Edition 1.12 and Pocket Edition 1.1.0 version of the game, the default color was changed to white.\nGallery[edit | edit source]\nScreenshots[edit | edit source]\nA sleeping player in multiplayer.\nThe message that can be seen after a failed attempt to respawn at the spawn point set by a bed.\nA crater created by attempting to sleep in the Nether.\nA crater created by attempting to sleep in the End.\nAll the different color variants.\nAn unemployed villager and a butcher villager goes to sleep, unaware of the zombies outside.\nA stack of beds.\nA player being awakened by a zombie.\nThe message that can be seen when any players attempt to sleep during daytime.\nA player going to sleep in a bed on the first day of a Minecraft world.\nA bed in an abandoned village has its bottom half replaced by wheat crops due to a glitch.\nThe updated Bedrock Edition sleep screen in Bed menu.\nMojang images[edit | edit source]\n\"Moments before disaster.\"\nIn other media[edit | edit source]\nThe Sham, a villainous, sentient bed featured in the Campfire Tales Skin Pack.\nThe rainbow bed, a unique bed featured in Minecraft Earth.\nEfe sleeping on a bed in A Tale of Two Friends.\nEfe gets off bed, from the same short film.\nA cyan bed from LEGO The Badlands Mineshaft.\nAn apartment with Minecraft furnishing.\nSee also[edit | edit source]\nOre UI, the Bedrock Edition UI refresh\nReferences[edit | edit source]\n↑ MC-192722 — Beds have no assigned tool\n↑ MCPE-28723 — Exploding bed in the Nether!? — resolved as \"Works As Intended\".

However, it can be broken using glitches involving a piston, but it does not drop as an item unless you use another glitch. It can also be broken with an explosion, because its blast resistance is only 3.6M.\nIn Java Edition 22w13oneBlockAtATime, bedrock is breakable in Survival, taking 15 minutes to break with empty hands and without a Haste effect applied.\nNatural generation[edit | edit source]\nBedrock comprises the five bottom-most layers of the Overworld and the Nether in a rough pattern, although the top four layers are predominantly flat bedrock with only rare gaps, rendering the lowest, completely flat fifth layer (at Y=-64) mostly inaccessible. The distribution of bedrock is dependent on world seed.\nIn the Nether, bedrock additionally comprises the top five layers in a rough pattern. At the top of the Nether (Y=127), the layer is composed solely of bedrock, preventing the player from ascending above Y=127 without switching gamemode to creative or spectator, or exploiting glitches. The patterns of bedrock are consistent in the Nether in Java and Bedrock editions.\nIn the End, a single block of bedrock generates on top of each end spike, each topped with an end crystal. The bedrock remains after the destruction of the crystal and is lit on fire indefinitely. Bedrock additionally comprises part of the exit portal at the center of the central island. Unlike in other dimensions, there is no bedrock floor at the bottom of the End, meaning it is possible to fall into the void without exploiting glitches.\nAn unlimited number of end gateways generate randomly across the outer End islands, each consisting of 12 blocks of bedrock.\nPost-generation[edit | edit source]\nIf the bedrock that makes up the exit portal is removed by any means, it regenerates when the ender dragon is defeated or re-summoned.\nAn end gateway is generated on the central End island upon the death of each ender dragon, which is mostly made of bedrock. A total of 20 of these gateways generate in a circle centered on the exit portal in set positions. A corresponding end gateway is generated in the inner edge of the outer islands after an end gateway on the central island is activated for the first time.\nUsage[edit | edit source]\nBedrock generated at the bottom of the Overworld and the Nether prevents players from falling into the void.\nThe bedrock ceiling in the Nether is intended to prevent players from accessing the space above Y=127, which is meant to be an empty out-of-bounds area. In Bedrock Edition, players cannot build in the space above the bedrock layer at Y=127. In Java Edition, the space between the top bedrock layer and Y=255, known as the Nether roof, functions identically to the rest of the Nether in terms of mob spawning and building for players, which is an intended feature.[1]\nBedrock generated around the end gateways and the exit portals protects them from being broken and keeps them accessible and usable.\nMobs do not spawn on bedrock. Endermen are unable to place the block they are holding onto bedrock.\nBeacons treat bedrock as a transparent block, meaning their beams can pass through it, allowing beacons to be used in the Nether.\nIn the End, any fire on bedrock never extinguishes naturally, similar to netherrack.\nTrapping the wither[edit | edit source]\nMain article: Tutorials/Wither cage\nSince bedrock is indestructible in Survival, it can be used against withers. Certain configurations of bedrock (such as that found under the exit portal) can be used to securely trap withers by spawning them below the bedrock. The wither can then be easily killed, utilized to break blocks automatically, or used to farm wither roses.\nEnd crystal[edit | edit source]\nBedrock is one of the only two blocks on which end crystals can be placed, the other being obsidian. Placing four end crystals on bedrock around the exit portals triggers respawning the ender dragon.\nPlacing an end crystal on bedrock in the End sets it on fire.\nNote blocks[edit | edit source]\nNote blocks can be placed above bedrock to produce \"bass drum\" sounds.\nPiston interactivity[edit | edit source]\nBedrock is unable to be pushed or pulled by either of the piston variants (regular or sticky).\nSounds[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition:\n[hide]\nv t e\nstone sound type\nSound Subtitles Source Description Resource location Translation key Volume Pitch Attenuation\ndistance\nBlock broken Blocks Once the block has broken block.stone.break subtitles.block.generic.break 1.0 0.8 16\nBlock placed Blocks When the block is placed block.stone.place subtitles.block.generic.place 1.0 0.8 16\nBlock breaking Blocks While the block is in the process of being broken block.stone.hit subtitles.block.generic.hit 0.25 0.5 16\nSomething falls on a block Entity-Dependent Falling on the block with fall damage block.stone.fall subtitles.block.generic.fall 0.5 0.75 16\nFootsteps Entity-Dependent Walking on the block block.stone.step subtitles.block.generic.footsteps 0.15 1.0 16\nBedrock Edition:\n[hide]\nv t e\nstone sound type\nSound Source Description Resource location Volume Pitch\nBlocks Once the block has broken dig.stone 1.0 0.8-1.0\nBlocks When the block is placed dig.stone 1.0 0.8-1.0\nBlocks While the block is in the process of being broken hit.stone 0.37 0.5\nPlayers Falling on the block with fall damage fall.stone 0.4 1.0\nPlayers Walking on the block step.stone 0.3 1.0\nBlocks Jumping from the block jump.stone 0.12 1.0\nBlocks Falling on the block without fall damage land.stone 0.22 1.0\nData values[edit | edit source]\nID[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition:\nName Identifier Form Block tags\n[hide]\nTranslation key\nBedrock bedrock Block & Item dragon_immune\ninfiniburn_end\nwither_immune\nlava_pool_stone_replaceables\nfeatures_cannot_replace\ngeode_invalid_blocks\nblock.minecraft.bedrock\nBedrock Edition:\nName Identifier Numeric ID Form Item ID[i 1]\n[hide]\nTranslation key\nBedrock bedrock 7 Block & Giveable Item[i 2] Identical[i 3]\ntile.bedrock.name\n↑ ID of block's direct item form, which is used in savegame files and addons.\n↑ Available with /give command.\n↑ The block's direct item form has the same ID as the block.\nBlock states[edit | edit source]\nSee also: Block states\nIn Bedrock Edition, bedrock uses the following block states:\nBedrock Edition:\nName Metadata Bits Default value Allowed values Values for\nMetadata Bits\n[hide]\nDescription\ninfiniburn_bit 0x1 false false\ntrue 0\n1 Specifies if this bedrock can burn indefinitely.\n\nVideo[edit | edit source]\nHistory[edit | edit source]\nThis section is missing information about: bedrock's blast resistance being changed from 18,000,000 to 3,600,000. \nPlease expand the section to include this information.

For more information, see Breaking § Speed.\nNatural generation[edit | edit source]\nA naturally generated bee nest in a village in a Superflat world.\nNaturally generated bee nests generate with 2-3 bees in them. The bee nests always face south.\nBee nests generate in the following biomes with different chances:\nBiome Chance[note 1]\nJava Edition Bedrock Edition\nMeadow\n100%\nCherry grove 5% Unknown\nPlains\nSunflower plains\n5%\nMangrove swamp\n1%\nFlower forest 2% 3%\nForest\nBirch forest\nOld growth birch forest 0.2% 0.035%\n↑ The chance for each naturally-generated oak, birch, mangrove tree, or cherry tree to have a bee nest.\nPost-generation[edit | edit source]\nOak, birch, or cherry trees grown from saplings that are within 2 blocks (including diagonally) of a flower on the same Y-level have a 5% chance to grow with a bee nest containing 2–3 bees. This holds true in any biome in any dimension, and for any flower including wither roses and flowering azaleas.\nMangroves grown from mangrove propagules have a 1% chance of having a bee nest containing 2-3 bees. Unlike birch, cherry and oak trees, no flowers are required for a bee nest to generate.[1]\nUsage[edit | edit source]\nBee housing[edit | edit source]\nDripping honey.\nBee nests and beehives can house up to 3 bees at a time. They can enter through any unobstructed side, top, or bottom, but can exit only from the front, and only if it's unobstructed by a solid block (including a non-full solid block in Bedrock Edition).\nBees fly into a nest or hive at night, during rain, and after loading up with pollen from a flower. They first look for one at the same coordinates as the last one they entered, but if there's no nest or hive there, or it already contains 3 bees when they arrive, they search the nearby area for another one.\nIgniting a nest or hive allows any bees inside to escape, possibly catching fire as they flee.\nHarvesting[edit | edit source]\nSee also: Tutorials/Honey farming\nBees are protected from a campfire by placing a carpet over it in Java Edition.\nOnce full, bee nests and beehives provide two harvestable products: honey and honeycomb.\nEach time a bee enters a nest or hive covered in pollen, it starts converting it to honey and honeycomb. After it's done, it waits for daylight with no rain (if necessary), then exits to go collect more pollen. If the bee hive or nest is in the Nether or in the End the bee exits as soon as it converts the pollen. When the bee exits, the hive increments its honey level by 1 and has a 1% chance to increment it by 2. Once it has the maximum honey level of 5, it changes its appearance to show honey oozing out and, if the block below it isn't a full solid block, starts dripping honey particles. (The dripping honey is decorative; it cannot be collected in a cauldron.) These changes signal that the hive or nest is ready for harvesting.\nTo harvest honey, the player uses a glass bottle on the nest or hive; the bottle then becomes a honey bottle. To harvest honeycomb, the player uses shears on the nest or hive, causing it to drop three honeycomb items. After harvesting, the hive or nest is reset to empty (honey level 0, with the default appearance).\nAlternatively, honey or honeycomb can be harvested by powering a redstone dispenser containing either a glass bottle or shears. The dispenser must be placed beside and facing the hive or nest.\nThis is the maximum distance a beehive can be from a campfire while applying the calming effect (5 blocks).\nHarvesting from a beehive or bee nest causes any bees inside it to become aggravated toward the player, unless there is a fire directly beneath it or a lit campfire within five blocks below, and the smoke is not obstructed. Smoke can pass through no more than one solid block, and only if that block is directly above the campfire. Placing a carpet above the campfire leaves room for the bees to hover beneath the nest and still avoid taking fire damage. In Java Edition, the smoke coming through the carpet also calms the bees. In Bedrock Edition, a carpet is treated as an obstruction that removes the calming effect of the campfire's smoke. Without a block covering the fire, the bees can still avoid fire damage if the campfire is placed 4–5 blocks below the nest.\nRedstone component[edit | edit source]\nBeehives and bee nests have comparator output with a strength equal to the honey level in the block. Once the beehive or bee nest is filled with honey it emits a signal strength of five.\nNote blocks[edit | edit source]\nBeehives and bee nests can be placed under note blocks to produce \"bass\" sound.\n\nSounds[edit | edit source]\nGeneric[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition:\n[hide]\nv t e\nwood sound type\nSound Subtitles Source Description Resource location Translation key Volume Pitch Attenuation\ndistance\nBlock broken Blocks Once the block has broken block.wood.break subtitles.block.generic.break 1.0 0.8 16\nBlock placed Blocks When the block is placed block.wood.place subtitles.block.generic.place 1.0 0.8 16\nBlock breaking Blocks While the block is in the process of being broken block.wood.hit subtitles.block.generic.hit 0.25 0.5 16\nSomething falls on a block Entity-Dependent Falling on the block with fall damage block.wood.fall subtitles.block.generic.fall 0.5 0.75 16\nFootsteps Entity-Dependent Walking on the block block.wood.step subtitles.block.generic.footsteps 0.15 1.0 16\nBedrock Edition:\n[hide]\nv t e\nnormal sound type\nSound Source Description Resource location Volume Pitch\nBlocks Once the block has broken dig.stone 1.0 0.8-1.0\nBlocks When the block is placed dig.stone 1.0 0.8-1.0\nBlocks While the block is in the process of being broken hit.stone 0.27 [sound 1] 0.5\nPlayers Falling on the block with fall damage fall.stone 0.4 1.0\nPlayers Walking on the block step.stone 0.3 1.0\nBlocks Jumping from the block jump.stone 0.12 1.0\nBlocks Falling on the block without fall damage land.stone 0.22 1.0\n↑ MCPE-169612 — Many blocks make slightly different sounds to stone\nUnique[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition:\n[hide]\nv t e\nSounds\nSound Subtitles Source Description Resource location Translation key Volume Pitch Attenuation\ndistance\nHoney drips Blocks When a honey drip particle hits a block block.beehive.drip subtitles.block.beehive.drip 0.09-0.3 varies [sound 1] 8\nBee enters hive Blocks When a bee enters a bee nest block.beehive.enter subtitles.block.beehive.enter 1.0 0.7/0.8 14\nBee leaves hive Blocks When a bee exits a bee nest block.beehive.exit subtitles.block.beehive.exit 1.0 0.9/1.0/1.1 14\nShears scrape Blocks When honeycombs are harvested from a bee nest block.beehive.shear subtitles.block.beehive.shear 0.8 1.0/0.8/0.9 16\nBees work Blocks Randomly while a bee is inside block.beehive.work subtitles.block.beehive.work 0.6 1.0 12\nBottle fills Blocks When a bottle is filled with honey item.bottle.fill subtitles.item.bottle.fill 1.0 1.0 16\n↑ Can be 0.7 or 0.9 for each sound\nBedrock Edition:\n[hide]\nv t e\nSounds\nSound Source Description Resource location Volume Pitch\nBlocks When a honey drip particle hits a block block.beehive.drip 0.3 0.7-0.9\nBlocks When a bee enters a bee nest block.beehive.enter 0.75 0.7-0.8\nBlocks When a bee exits a bee nest block.beehive.exit 0.75 0.9-1.1\nBlocks When honeycombs are collected from a bee nest block.beehive.shear 0.8 0.8-1.0\nBlocks Randomly while a bee is inside block.beehive.work 0.6 1.0\nBlocks When a bottle is filled with honey[sound 1] bucket.fill_water 1.0 1.0\n↑ MCPE-53881\nData values[edit | edit source]\nID[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition:\nName Identifier Form Block tags\n[hide]\nTranslation key\nBee Nest bee_nest Block & Item beehives\nblock.minecraft.bee_nest\nName\n[hide]\nIdentifier\nBlock entity beehive\nBedrock Edition:\nName Identifier Numeric ID Form Item ID[i 1]\n[hide]\nTranslation key\nBee Nest bee_nest 473 Block & Giveable Item[i 2] Identical[i 3]\ntile.bee_nest.name\n↑ ID of block's direct item form, which is used in savegame files and addons.\n↑ Available with /give command.\n↑ The block's direct item form has the same ID as the block.\nName\n[hide]\nSavegame ID\nBlock entity Beehive\nBlock states[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition:\nName Default value Allowed values\n[hide]\nDescription\nfacing north east\nnorth\nsouth\nwest The opposite from the direction the player faces while placing the block.\nhoney_level 0 0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5 Every pollinated bee that leaves the hive after working increases the honey level by one.

When the bee exits, the hive increments its honey level by 1 and has a 1% chance to increment it by 2. Once it has the maximum honey level of 5, it changes its appearance to show honey oozing out and, if the block below it isn't a full solid block, starts dripping honey particles. (The dripping honey is decorative; it cannot be collected in a cauldron.) These changes signal that the hive or nest is ready for harvesting.\nTo harvest honey, the player uses a glass bottle on the nest or hive; the bottle then becomes a honey bottle. To harvest honeycomb, the player uses shears on the nest or hive, causing it to drop three honeycomb items. After harvesting, the hive or nest is reset to empty (honey level 0, with the default appearance).\nAlternatively, honey or honeycomb can be harvested by powering a redstone dispenser containing either a glass bottle or shears. The dispenser must be placed beside and facing the hive or nest.\nThis is the maximum distance a beehive can be from a campfire while applying the calming effect (5 blocks).\nHarvesting from a beehive or bee nest causes any bees inside it to become aggravated toward the player, unless there is a fire directly beneath it or a lit campfire within five blocks below, and the smoke is not obstructed. Smoke can pass through no more than one solid block, and only if that block is directly above the campfire. Placing a carpet above the campfire leaves room for the bees to hover beneath the nest and still avoid taking fire damage. In Java Edition, the smoke coming through the carpet also calms the bees. In Bedrock Edition, a carpet is treated as an obstruction that removes the calming effect of the campfire's smoke. Without a block covering the fire, the bees can still avoid fire damage if the campfire is placed 4–5 blocks below the nest.\nRedstone component[edit | edit source]\nBeehives and bee nests have comparator output with a strength equal to the honey level in the block. Once the beehive or bee nest is filled with honey it emits a signal strength of five.\nNote blocks[edit | edit source]\nBeehives and bee nests can be placed under note blocks to produce \"bass\" sound.\n\nSounds[edit | edit source]\nGeneric[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition:\n[hide]\nv t e\nwood sound type\nSound Subtitles Source Description Resource location Translation key Volume Pitch Attenuation\ndistance\nBlock broken Blocks Once the block has broken block.wood.break subtitles.block.generic.break 1.0 0.8 16\nBlock placed Blocks When the block is placed block.wood.place subtitles.block.generic.place 1.0 0.8 16\nBlock breaking Blocks While the block is in the process of being broken block.wood.hit subtitles.block.generic.hit 0.25 0.5 16\nSomething falls on a block Entity-Dependent Falling on the block with fall damage block.wood.fall subtitles.block.generic.fall 0.5 0.75 16\nFootsteps Entity-Dependent Walking on the block block.wood.step subtitles.block.generic.footsteps 0.15 1.0 16\nBedrock Edition:\n[hide]\nv t e\nnormal sound type\nSound Source Description Resource location Volume Pitch\nBlocks Once the block has broken dig.stone 1.0 0.8-1.0\nBlocks When the block is placed dig.stone 1.0 0.8-1.0\nBlocks While the block is in the process of being broken hit.stone 0.27 [sound 1] 0.5\nPlayers Falling on the block with fall damage fall.stone 0.4 1.0\nPlayers Walking on the block step.stone 0.3 1.0\nBlocks Jumping from the block jump.stone 0.12 1.0\nBlocks Falling on the block without fall damage land.stone 0.22 1.0\n↑ MCPE-169612 — Many blocks make slightly different sounds to stone\nUnique[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition:\n[hide]\nv t e\nSounds\nSound Subtitles Source Description Resource location Translation key Volume Pitch Attenuation\ndistance\nHoney drips Blocks When a honey drip particle hits a block block.beehive.drip subtitles.block.beehive.drip 0.09-0.3 varies [sound 1] 8\nBee enters hive Blocks When a bee enters a beehive block.beehive.enter subtitles.block.beehive.enter 1.0 0.7/0.8 14\nBee leaves hive Blocks When a bee exits a beehive block.beehive.exit subtitles.block.beehive.exit 1.0 0.9/1.0/1.1 14\nShears scrape Blocks When honeycombs are harvested from a beehive block.beehive.shear subtitles.block.beehive.shear 0.8 1.0/0.8/0.9 16\nBees work Blocks Randomly while a bee is inside block.beehive.work subtitles.block.beehive.work 0.6 1.0 12\nBottle fills Blocks When a bottle is filled with honey item.bottle.fill subtitles.item.bottle.fill 1.0 1.0 16\n↑ Can be 0.7 or 0.9 for each sound\nBedrock Edition:\n[hide]\nv t e\nSounds\nSound Source Description Resource location Volume Pitch\nBlocks When a honey drip particle hits a block block.beehive.drip 0.3 0.7-0.9\nBlocks When a bee enters a beehive block.beehive.enter 0.75 0.7-0.8\nBlocks When a bee exits a beehive block.beehive.exit 0.75 0.9-1.1\nBlocks When honeycombs are collected from a beehive block.beehive.shear 0.8 0.8-1.0\nBlocks Randomly while a bee is inside block.beehive.work 0.6 1.0\nBlocks When a bottle is filled with honey[sound 1] bucket.fill_water 1.0 1.0\n↑ MCPE-53881\nData values[edit | edit source]\nID[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition:\nName Identifier Form Block tags\n[hide]\nTranslation key\nBeehive beehive Block & Item beehives\nblock.minecraft.beehive\nName\n[hide]\nIdentifier\nBlock entity beehive\nBedrock Edition:\nName Identifier Numeric ID Form Item ID[i 1]\n[hide]\nTranslation key\nBeehive beehive 474 Block & Giveable Item[i 2] Identical[i 3]\ntile.beehive.name\n↑ ID of block's direct item form, which is used in savegame files and addons.\n↑ Available with /give command.\n↑ The block's direct item form has the same ID as the block.\nName\n[hide]\nSavegame ID\nBlock entity Beehive\nBlock states[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition:\nName Default value Allowed values\n[hide]\nDescription\nfacing north east\nnorth\nsouth\nwest The opposite from the direction the player faces while placing the block.\nhoney_level 0 0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5 Every pollinated bee that leaves the hive after working increases the honey level by one.

The seeds require a light level of 8 or greater to plant‌[Java Edition only] and 9 or greater to grow. In Bedrock Edition they can be planted at any light level, but need a internal light level of 9 to grow. When fully grown, the plant can be broken to harvest beetroot seeds and beetroots.\nWhile beetroot crops have only four growth stages compared to eight for wheat, carrots and potatoes, each growth tick has a 1⁄3 chance of not advancing the growth stage and therefore beetroot grows slightly faster than other crops.\nCrops grow faster if the farmland they are planted in is hydrated. One application of bone meal has a 75% chance of advancing growth by one stage. This is less effective than for other crops: an average of 5 1⁄3 are needed to fully grow beetroot compared to 2 2⁄7 for other crops.\nCrops break if pushed by a piston or if their supporting farmland breaks or turns to dirt (e.g. by being trampled), dropping their usual drops.\nBreeding[edit | edit source]\nLike other seeds, beetroot seeds can be used to breed chickens, lead chickens around, and make baby chickens grow up faster by 10% of the remaining time.\nTaming[edit | edit source]\nLike other seeds, beetroot seeds can be used to tame parrots.\nComposting[edit | edit source]\nPlacing beetroot seeds into a composter has a 30% chance of raising the compost level by 1.\nSounds[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition:\n[hide]\nv t e\ncrop sound type\nSound Subtitles Source Description Resource location Translation key Volume Pitch Attenuation\ndistance\nBlock broken Blocks Once the block has broken block.crop.break subtitles.block.generic.break 0.9 0.8 16\nBlock placed Blocks When the block is placed item.crop.plant[sound 1] subtitles.block.generic.place 0.45 varies [sound 2] 16\nBlock breaking Blocks While the block is in the process of being broken block.grass.hit subtitles.block.generic.hit 0.25 0.5 16\nSomething falls on a block Entity-Dependent Falling on the block with fall damage block.grass.fall subtitles.block.generic.fall 0.5 0.75 16\nFootsteps Entity-Dependent Walking on the block block.grass.step subtitles.block.generic.footsteps 0.15 1.0 16\n↑ Unlike all other block placement sound events, these are listed under items.

For more information, see Breaking § Speed.\nNatural generation[edit | edit source]\nBells can generate naturally in all village variants, usually near the center of the village in the meeting point.\nGenerated loot[edit | edit source]\nItem Structure Container Quantity\n[hide]\nChance\nJava Edition and Bedrock Edition\nBell Ruined Portal Chest 1 1.5%\nTrading[edit | edit source]\nVillager Probability Villager wants Player receives\nJE BE\nApprentice Armorer 50% 33% 36 × Emerald Bell\nApprentice Toolsmith 100% 100% 36 × Emerald Bell\nApprentice Weaponsmith 100% 100% 36 × Emerald Bell\nUsage[edit | edit source]\nBells can be anchored to the side of blocks, ceilings, and floors and drop as an item if the sustain block is broken or moved by a piston. They can also be attached to trapdoors but break if the trapdoor is opened.\nWhen the use control is pressed while looking at the side of a bell, it produces a sound as well as a \"swaying\" animation. A bell can also be rung using a redstone signal, by any projectile, or by dropping an item on it. ‌[Bedrock Edition only]\nIf the player rings the bell while villagers are sleeping, all of the villagers wake up. Bells can be rung by players only from certain angles (villagers are not subject to this restriction); trying from an incorrect angle does not cause the bell to ring.\nVillagers ring the bell only during raids.\nClaiming[edit | edit source]\nA villager can detect a bell within 48 blocks euclidean distance horizontally and 6 block vertically (either up or down) from the base of his hitbox and can claim it if he gets within 6 blocks taxicab distance of it and there is a valid path that can lead them to be in the block right besides the bell. Baby villagers do not claim nor ring a bell.\nWhen villagers spawn and have not already claimed a bed or workstation, they will automatically claim any bell 6 blocks from them, even if they cannot reach it. Additionally, when a bell is placed within 48 blocks from the pillow of a claimed bed and there is a valid path a villager can walk through, the bell gets automatically claimed in the afternoon (between 9000t and 12000t), which is displayed by green particles appearing above the bell. This does not work with claimed workstations.\nClaimed bells are POIs and determine the position of a village center among claimed beds and workstations.\nWhen a player subject to the Bad Omen effect enters a village with a bell, the claiming mechanisms are forced no matter the time, meaning that if the bell is close enough either from a villager or from a claimed bed, it becomes part of the village.\nA claimed bell defines a gathering site of a village, and villagers pathfind close to it in the afternoon.\nIf the bell is broken, anger particles appear above the village leader's head.‌[Bedrock Edition only]\nIf a player rings a bell, the villagers run to their houses even if there is no raid. Villagers can activate a bell even through blocks, but only if it was previously claimed and at least 2 blocks (also diagonal) from the base of their hitbox.\nRaid[edit | edit source]\nSee also: Tutorials/Defeating a village raid\nWhen the bell is rung, villagers within a distance of 32 blocks run to the nearest bed within 32 blocks immediately.\nIn Java Edition, when a raid's first wave appears, at least one villager rushes to ring the bell in the center of the village (if they are close enough) to warn the other villagers of an incoming raid before going into their house. In Bedrock Edition, bells in the corresponding village ring automatically at the start of a raid, warning villagers to return to their houses.\nGlowing effect[edit | edit source]\nIn Java Edition, if a bell is rung and there is a raid mob within a 32 block spherical range, the Glowing effect is applied to all raid mobs within 48 blocks for 3 seconds, and particles appear. It produces a resonating sound once this process is complete. The raid mobs do not have to be actively participating in a raid to receive the Glowing effect; the effect applies to illagers in woodland mansions, or witches that naturally spawn in the Overworld.\nPiglins[edit | edit source]\nPiglins admire bells as golden items. However, breaking a bell does not aggravate them.[1]\nRedstone component[edit | edit source]\nIn Java Edition, bells ring one time upon receiving a redstone signal. Observers can detect when a bell receives a redstone signal, and when it stops receiving a signal (corresponding to the powered block state). Observers cannot detect when a bell is activated by the player or other entities. Sculk sensors, however, can detect a bell being rung in any way, or when placed or broken. Bells are transparent blocks and cannot be powered.\nIn Bedrock Edition, observers can detect when a bell is rung. Observers do not emit a signal when the bell stops ringing or becomes unpowered.\nSounds[edit | edit source]\nGeneric[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition:\n[hide]\nv t e\nanvil sound type\nSound Subtitles Source Description Resource location Translation key Volume Pitch Attenuation\ndistance\nBlock broken Blocks Once the block has broken block.anvil.break subtitles.block.generic.break 0.65 0.8 16\nBlock placed Blocks When the block is placed block.anvil.place subtitles.block.generic.place 0.65 0.8 16\nBlock breaking Blocks While the block is in the process of being broken block.anvil.hit subtitles.block.generic.hit 0.1625 0.5 16\nSomething falls on a block Entity-Dependent Falling on the block with fall damage block.anvil.fall subtitles.block.generic.fall 0.15 0.75 16\nFootsteps Entity-Dependent Walking on the block block.anvil.step subtitles.block.generic.footsteps 0.045 1.0 16\nBedrock Edition: [sound 1]\n[hide]\nv t e\nmetal sound type\nSound Source Description Resource location Volume Pitch\nBlocks Once the block has broken dig.stone 1.0 1.1-1.2\nBlocks When the block is placed use.stone 1.0 1.2-1.25\nBlocks While the block is in the process of being broken hit.stone 0.3 0.75\nPlayers Falling on the block with fall damage fall.stone 0.4 1.0\nPlayers Walking on the block step.stone 0.35 1.0\nBlocks Jumping from the block jump.stone 0.12 1.0\nBlocks Falling on the block without fall damage land.stone 0.22 1.0\n↑ MCPE-140091 — Bell makes incorrect sounds when placed\nUnique[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition\n[hide]\nSounds\nSound Subtitles Source Description Resource location Translation key Volume Pitch Attenuation\ndistance\nBell rings Blocks When a bell is hit block.bell.use subtitles.block.bell.use 24.0 varies [sound 1] 16\nBell resonates Blocks When a bell is rung and raiders are nearby block.bell.resonate subtitles.block.bell.resonate 1.0 varies [sound 2] 16\n↑ Can be 0.93, 0.95, or 0.97 for each sound\n↑ Can be 0.85, 0.9, or 1.0 for each sound\nBedrock Edition:\n[hide]\nSounds\nSound Source Description Resource location Volume Pitch\nBlocks When a bell is hit block.bell.hit 1.0 varies [sound 1]\n↑ Can be 0.93, 0.95, or 0.97 for each sound\nData values[edit | edit source]\nID[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition:\nName Identifier Form Item tags\n[hide]\nTranslation key\nBell bell Block & Item piglin_loved\nblock.minecraft.bell\nName\n[hide]\nIdentifier\nBlock entity bell\nBedrock Edition:\nName Identifier Numeric ID Form Item ID[i 1]\n[hide]\nTranslation key\nBell bell 461 Block & Giveable Item[i 2] Identical[i 3]\n(Numeric: -206)\ntile.bell.name\n↑ ID of block's direct item form, which is used in savegame files and addons.\n↑ Available with /give command.\n↑ The block's direct item form has the same ID as the block.\nName\n[hide]\nSavegame ID\nBlock entity Bell\nBlock states[edit | edit source]\nSee also: Block states\nJava Edition:\nName Default value Allowed values\n[hide]\nDescription\nattachment floor ceiling\ndouble_wall\nfloor\nsingle_wall What the bell is attached to.\nfacing north east\nnorth\nsouth\nwest The direction the bell is facing.\nOpposite from the direction the player faces when placing a bell.\npowered false true\nfalse Whether the bell is attached to a power source, such as a redstone torch.\nBedrock Edition:\nName Metadata Bits Default value Allowed values Values for\nMetadata Bits\n[hide]\nDescription\nattachment 0x4\n0x8 standing standing\nhanging\nside\nmultiple 0\n1\n2\n3 What the bell is attached to.\ndirection 0x1\n0x2 0 0\n1\n2\n3 0\n1\n2\n3 The direction the bell is facing.

For more information, see Breaking § Speed.\nNatural generation[edit | edit source]\nBig dripleaves naturally generate within lush caves biome.\nPost-generation[edit | edit source]\nBone meal can be used on a small dripleaf plant to turn it into a big dripleaf up to 5 blocks tall, as long as there is enough open space above it. Using bone meal on a big dripleaf plant makes it one block taller, creating an extra stem block (see #Growth).\nRenewability[edit | edit source]\nAs wandering traders sell small dripleaves for an emerald. Applying bone meal to small dripleaves turns them into big dripleaves, making them renewable.\nUsage[edit | edit source]\nBig dripleaves consist of any number of non-solid stem blocks atop of each other and a single leaf as the uppermost block, which can be stood on by any entity like a normal block for 1 second (20 game ticks). After this time, it tilts down, becoming lower than a block and giving a player warning that it is about to collapse. After a few ticks, it tilts down and becomes temporarily non-solid.\nWhen the leaf is powered by redstone, it does not tilt or collapse. Powering the stem has no effect.\nOne-block tall big dripleaves can be used to make the player crawl. If a player is standing inside a big dripleaf when it is fully tilted, and the dripleaf returns to the untilted position, the player is left crawling underneath the leaf.\nWhen directly hit with any projectile, the leaf immediately becomes temporarily non-solid. This cannot be prevented by powering it with redstone.\nFrogs enjoy jumping on big dripleaves, although the dripleaf tilts down and drops the frog, unless the dripleaf is powered by redstone.\nPlacement[edit | edit source]\nBig dripleaves can be placed only on top of clay, coarse dirt, dirt, farmland, grass blocks, moss blocks, mud, muddy mangrove roots, mycelium, podzol, and rooted dirt. Until Java Edition 1.21.5, they can also be planted on pale moss blocks. Big dripleaves can also be placed underwater. A big dripleaf is always one block tall when placed.\nGrowth[edit | edit source]\nUsing bone meal on a big dripleaf makes it grow 1 block taller, unless there is a block above the leaf other than air or water. Unlike most plants, dripleaf does not grow by itself: bone meal must be applied for growth to occur.\nComposting[edit | edit source]\nPlacing a big dripleaf into a composter has a 65% chance of raising the compost level by 1.\nSounds[edit | edit source]\nGeneric[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition:\n[hide]\nv t e\nbig_dripleaf sound type\nSound Subtitles Source Description Resource location Translation key Volume Pitch Attenuation\ndistance\nBlock broken Blocks Once the block has broken block.big_dripleaf.break subtitles.block.generic.break 1.0 0.8 16\nBlock placed Blocks When the block is placed block.big_dripleaf.place subtitles.block.generic.place 1.0 0.8 16\nBlock breaking Blocks While the block is in the process of being broken block.big_dripleaf.hit subtitles.block.generic.hit 0.25 0.5 16\nSomething falls on a block Entity-Dependent Falling on the block with fall damage block.big_dripleaf.fall subtitles.block.generic.fall 0.5 0.75 16\nFootsteps Entity-Dependent Walking on the block block.big_dripleaf.step subtitles.block.generic.footsteps 0.15 1.0 16\nBedrock Edition:\n[hide]\nv t e\nbig_dripleaf sound type\nSound Source Description Resource location Volume Pitch\nBlocks Once the block has broken break.big_dripleaf 1.0 0.8-1.0\nBlocks When the block is placed place.big_dripleaf 1.0 0.8-1.0\nBlocks While the block is in the process of being broken hit.big_dripleaf 0.35 0.5\nPlayers Falling on the block with fall damage fall.big_dripleaf 0.4 1.0\nPlayers Walking on the block step.big_dripleaf 0.17 1.0\nPlayers Jumping from the block jump.big_dripleaf 0.12 1.0\nPlayers Falling on the block without fall damage land.big_dripleaf 0.14 1.0\nUnique[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition\n[hide]\nSounds\nSound Subtitles Source Description Resource location Translation key Volume Pitch Attenuation\ndistance\nDripleaf tilts down Blocks When a big dripleaf tilts down block.big_dripleaf.tilt_down subtitles.block.big_dripleaf.tilt_down 1.0 0.8-1.2 16\nDripleaf tilts up Blocks When a big dripleaf tilts up block.big_dripleaf.tilt_up subtitles.block.big_dripleaf.tilt_up 1.0 0.8-1.2 16\nBedrock Edition:\n[hide]\nSounds\nSound Source Description Resource location Volume Pitch\nBlocks When a big dripleaf tilts down tilt_down.big_dripleaf 1.0 0.8-1.2\nBlocks When a big dripleaf tilts up tilt_up.big_dripleaf 1.0 0.8-1.2\nData values[edit | edit source]\nID[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition:\nName Identifier Form Block tags\n[hide]\nTranslation key\nBig Dripleaf big_dripleaf Block & Item lush_plants_replaceable\nblock.minecraft.big_dripleaf\nBig Dripleaf Stem big_dripleaf_stem Block lush_plants_replaceable\nblock.minecraft.big_dripleaf_stem\nBedrock Edition:\nName Identifier Numeric ID Form Item ID[i 1]\n[hide]\nTranslation key\nBig Dripleaf big_dripleaf 578 Block & Giveable Item[i 2] Identical[i 3]\n(Numeric: -323)\ntile.big_dripleaf.name\n↑ ID of block's direct item form, which is used in savegame files and addons.\n↑ Available with /give command.\n↑ The block's direct item form has the same ID as the block.\nBlock states[edit | edit source]\nSee also: Block states\nJava Edition:\nLeaf:\nName Default value Allowed values\n[hide]\nDescription\nfacing north east\nnorth\nsouth\nwest The direction the big dripleaf is facing.\nThe opposite from the direction the player faces while placing the big dripleaf.\ntilt none full\nnone\npartial\nunstable How far this big dripleaf is tilted.\nwaterlogged false false\ntrue Whether there is water in the same place as this big dripleaf.\nStem:\nName Default value Allowed values\n[hide]\nDescription\nfacing north east\nnorth\nsouth\nwest The direction the big dripleaf stem is facing.\nwaterlogged false false\ntrue Whether there is water in the same place as this big dripleaf stem.\n\nBedrock Edition:\nName Metadata Bits Default value Allowed values Values for\nMetadata Bits\n[hide]\nDescription\nbig_dripleaf_head Not Supported 1 0\n1 Unsupported Whether this is the leaf part or the stem part of big dripleaf.\nbig_dripleaf_tilt Not Supported none none\nunstable\npartial_tilt\nfull_tilt Unsupported How far this big dripleaf is tilted.\nminecraft:cardinal_direction Not Supported south east\nnorth\nsouth\nwest Unsupported The direction the big dripleaf is facing.\nThe opposite from the direction the player faces while placing the big dripleaf.\n\nHistory[edit | edit source]\nOctober 3, 2020 Dripleaves (named as Dripleaf Plant) are announced at Minecraft Live 2020.\nNovember 27, 2020 The big dripleaf has a new texture in a tweet from Agnes Larsson.\n[hide]\nJava Edition\n1.17 21w05a Added dripleaves\n21w06a Big Dripleaves can no longer be broken with arrows in spawn protection.[1]\nNo longer stop tilting while sneaking on, jumping on, or even jumping off it.\nNow tilt quicker.\nNow tilt when hit by projectiles, instead of being broken.\nBig dripleaf can be used with redstone: powering a dripleaf now prevents it from tilting down.

For more information, see Breaking § Speed.\nNatural generation[edit | edit source]\nBlackstone generates naturally in the Nether, particularly in the basalt deltas biome, below the surface of a lava sea, and anywhere underground.\nBlackstone can be found as a part of bastion remnants.\nOre blobs of blackstone attempt to replace netherrack 2 times per chunk in blobs of size 0 to 160, from levels 5 to 31‌[JE only]/36‌[BE only], in all Nether biomes except basalt deltas.\nIn Java Edition, blackstones also generate in big blobs, which attempt to replace netherrack 25 times per chunk in blobs of radius 3—7, from Y-levels 0 to 127, in basalt deltas biome.\nBartering[edit | edit source]\nPiglins may barter 8-16 blocks of blackstone when given a gold ingot.\nUsage[edit | edit source]\nBlackstone can be used as a substitute for cobblestone in the Nether as it can be used to craft stone tools, brewing stands, and furnaces. It can also be used to repair stone tools using an anvil. It can also be used to craft polished blackstone.\nBlackstone cannot be used to craft dispensers, droppers, pistons, or other blocks that use cobblestone in their recipes.[1]\nCrafting ingredient[edit

Blast furnaces can also generate in trail ruins.\nCrafting[edit | edit source]\nIngredients\n[hide]\nCrafting recipe\nIron Ingot +\nFurnace +\nSmooth Stone\n\nUsage[edit | edit source]\nBlast furnaces can be pushed by pistons.‌[Bedrock Edition only]\nSmelting[edit | edit source]\nThe GUI for the blast furnace, same as the ordinary furnace's.\nMain article: Smelting\nBlast furnaces are similar to furnaces, but can smelt only raw metal, ore blocks and tools/armor made of iron, gold or chainmail. Blast furnaces serve as the counterpart to smokers, which are used mainly to cook food faster. Smelting equipment yields one iron or gold nugget from their respective materials. Once an item and a fuel are placed into the blast furnace, the block state changes to lit and the item is smelted twice as fast as a regular furnace. Fuel is also used at double the rate of regular furnaces, so the number of items smelted per fuel stays the same. The product can then be collected by using the output. Like normal furnaces, a hopper can be used to feed items into or collect items from a blast furnace.\nProfession[edit | edit source]\nMain article: Job site block\nIf a blast furnace has not been claimed by a villager, any nearby unemployed villager has a chance to change their profession to armorer and claim the blast furnace as their job site block.\nLight source[edit | edit source]\nBlast furnaces emit a light level of 13 when active, similar to normal furnaces.\nCustom name[edit | edit source]\nBy default, the interface of a blast furnace is labeled \"Blast Furnace\", but this name can be customized by naming it in an anvil before placing it, or by changing the CustomName tag using the /data command.‌[Java Edition only]\nLock[edit | edit source]\nIn Java Edition, a blast furnace can be \"locked\" by setting its Lock tag using the /data command. If a blast furnace's Lock tag is not blank, the blast furnace cannot be opened unless the player is holding an item with the same name as the Lock tag's text. For example, to lock a blast furnace at (0,64,0) so that the blast furnace cannot be opened unless the player is holding an item named \"Blast Furnace Key\", use /data merge block 0 64 0 {Lock:\"Blast Furnace Key\"}.\nNote blocks[edit | edit source]\nBlast furnace can be placed under note blocks to produce \"bass drum\" sounds.\nSounds[edit | edit source]\nGeneric[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition:\n[hide]\nv t e\nstone sound type\nSound Subtitles Source Description Resource location Translation key Volume Pitch Attenuation\ndistance\nBlock broken Blocks Once the block has broken block.stone.break subtitles.block.generic.break 1.0 0.8 16\nBlock placed Blocks When the block is placed block.stone.place subtitles.block.generic.place 1.0 0.8 16\nBlock breaking Blocks While the block is in the process of being broken block.stone.hit subtitles.block.generic.hit 0.25 0.5 16\nSomething falls on a block Entity-Dependent Falling on the block with fall damage block.stone.fall subtitles.block.generic.fall 0.5 0.75 16\nFootsteps Entity-Dependent Walking on the block block.stone.step subtitles.block.generic.footsteps 0.15 1.0 16\nBedrock Edition:\n[hide]\nv t e\nstone sound type\nSound Source Description Resource location Volume Pitch\nBlocks Once the block has broken dig.stone 1.0 0.8-1.0\nBlocks When the block is placed dig.stone 1.0 0.8-1.0\nBlocks While the block is in the process of being broken hit.stone 0.37 0.5\nPlayers Falling on the block with fall damage fall.stone 0.4 1.0\nPlayers Walking on the block step.stone 0.3 1.0\nBlocks Jumping from the block jump.stone 0.12 1.0\nBlocks Falling on the block without fall damage land.stone 0.22 1.0\nUnique[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition\n[hide]\nSounds\nSound Subtitles Source Description Resource location Translation key Volume Pitch Attenuation\ndistance\nBlast furnace crackles Blocks Randomly while lit block.blastfurnace.fire_crackle[sound 1] subtitles.block.blastfurnace.fire_crackle[sound 1] 1.0 1.0 16\nArmorer works Friendly Creatures Randomly while an armorer is working entity.villager.work_armorer subtitles.entity.villager.work_armorer 1.0 0.8-1.2 16\nChest locked[sound 2] Blocks When a player attempts to open a blast furnace locked using the [String] Lock tag block.chest.locked[sound 2] subtitles.block.chest.locked[sound 2] 1.0 1.0 16\n↑\na b MC-179832\n↑\na b c MC-98316 — Wrong subtitles caused by missing distinction\nBedrock Edition:\n[hide]\nSounds\nSound Source Description Resource location Volume Pitch\nBlocks Randomly while lit block.blastfurnace.fire_crackle 3.0 0.6\nBlocks Randomly while an armorer is working block.blastfurnace.fire_crackle 3.0 0.6\nData values[edit | edit source]\nID[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition:\nName Identifier Form\n[hide]\nTranslation key\nBlast Furnace blast_furnace Block & Item\nblock.minecraft.blast_furnace\nName\n[hide]\nIdentifier\nBlock entity blast_furnace\nBedrock Edition:\nName Identifier Numeric ID Form Item ID[i 1]\n[hide]\nTranslation key\nUnlit block blast_furnace 451 Block & Giveable Item[i 2] Identical[i 3]\n(Numeric: -196)\ntile.blast_furnace.name\nLit block lit_blast_furnace 469 Block & Ungiveable Item[i 4] Identical[i 3]\n(Numeric: -214)\n—\n↑ ID of block's direct item form, which is used in savegame files and addons.\n↑ Available with /give command.\n↑\na b The block's direct item form has the same ID as the block.\n↑ Unavailable with /give command\nName\n[hide]\nSavegame ID\nBlock entity BlastFurnace\nBlock states[edit | edit source]\nSee also: Block states\nJava Edition:\nName Default value Allowed values\n[hide]\nDescription\nfacing north east\nnorth\nsouth\nwest The direction the blast furnace's opening faces.\nThe opposite from the direction the player faces while placing the blast furnace.\nlit false false\ntrue If the blast furnace is lit.\nBedrock Edition:\nName Metadata Bits Default value Allowed values Values for\nMetadata Bits\n[hide]\nDescription\nminecraft:cardinal_direction Not Supported south east\nnorth\nsouth\nwest Unsupported The direction the blast furnace's opening faces.\nThe opposite from the direction the player faces while placing the blast furnace.\n\nBlock data[edit | edit source]\nA blast furnace has a block entity associated with it that holds additional data about the block.\nJava Edition:\nSee also: Block entity format\n[NBT Compound / JSON Object] Block entity data\nTags common to all block entities[show]\n[Short] lit_time_remaining: Number of ticks left before the current fuel runs out.\n[Short] cooking_time_spent: Number of ticks the item has been smelting for.

The latter, however, prevents inactive furnace use; while smelting one item with one coal wastes seven potential items, smelting one item with one block of coal wastes 79 potential items.\nNote blocks[edit | edit source]\nBlocks of coal can be placed under note blocks to produce \"bass drum\" sounds.\nSounds[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition:\n[hide]\nv t e\nstone sound type\nSound Subtitles Source Description Resource location Translation key Volume Pitch Attenuation\ndistance\nBlock broken Blocks Once the block has broken block.stone.break subtitles.block.generic.break 1.0 0.8 16\nBlock placed Blocks When the block is placed block.stone.place subtitles.block.generic.place 1.0 0.8 16\nBlock breaking Blocks While the block is in the process of being broken block.stone.hit subtitles.block.generic.hit 0.25 0.5 16\nSomething falls on a block Entity-Dependent Falling on the block with fall damage block.stone.fall subtitles.block.generic.fall 0.5 0.75 16\nFootsteps Entity-Dependent Walking on the block block.stone.step subtitles.block.generic.footsteps 0.15 1.0 16\nBedrock Edition:\n[hide]\nv t e\nstone sound type\nSound Source Description Resource location Volume Pitch\nBlocks Once the block has broken dig.stone 1.0 0.8-1.0\nBlocks When the block is placed dig.stone 1.0 0.8-1.0\nBlocks While the block is in the process of being broken hit.stone 0.37 0.5\nPlayers Falling on the block with fall damage fall.stone 0.4 1.0\nPlayers Walking on the block step.stone 0.3 1.0\nBlocks Jumping from the block jump.stone 0.12 1.0\nBlocks Falling on the block without fall damage land.stone 0.22 1.0\nData values[edit | edit source]\nID[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition:\nName Identifier Form Block tags\n[hide]\nTranslation key\nBlock of Coal coal_block Block & Item mineable/pickaxe\nblock.minecraft.coal_block\nBedrock Edition:\nName Identifier Numeric ID Form Item ID[i 1]\n[hide]\nTranslation key\nBlock of Coal coal_block 173 Block & Giveable Item[i 2] Identical[i 3]\ntile.coal_block.name\n↑ ID of block's direct item form, which is used in savegame files and addons.\n↑ Available with /give command.\n↑ The block's direct item form has the same ID as the block.\nVideo[edit | edit source]\nHistory[edit | edit source]\n[hide]\nJava Edition\n2.0 Added blocks of coal to the April Fool's 'update', Minecraft 2.0, using a recolored version of the Block of Redstone texture.

Waxed copper blocks do not oxidize and are identical to the non-waxed version.\nScraping[edit | edit source]\nUsing an axe on a waxed block of copper turns it into the respective non-waxed block of copper. In addition, using an axe on an exposed, weathered, or oxidized block of copper reverts it one stage to a regular, exposed, or weathered copper block respectively.\nScraping with an axe is not possible when holding a shield in the offhand, so that combat is not affected when the player is near waxed or oxidized copper blocks.[1]\nLightning strike[edit | edit source]\nNon-waxed blocks of copper are completely deoxidized when struck by lightning, and other non-waxed blocks of copper nearby are deoxidized randomly.\nUsage[edit | edit source]\nBlocks of copper can be used to store copper ingots in a compact fashion. Exposed, weathered, and oxidized variants cannot be crafted back into copper ingots, but the unoxidized waxed block variant can. Unlike the cut variant, blocks of copper cannot be crafted directly into slabs or stairs without a stonecutter. Stonecutting blocks of copper gives four times more products than typical for stone, and allows slabs and stairs to be obtained.\nCrafting ingredient[edit | edit source]\nName Ingredients\n[hide]\nCrafting recipe\nBolt Armor Trim Smithing Template Diamond +\nBolt Armor Trim +\nBlock of Copper or\nWaxed Block of Copper\n\n2\nCopper Bulb or\nExposed Copper Bulb or\nWeathered Copper Bulb or\nOxidized Copper Bulb or\nWaxed Copper Bulb or\nWaxed Exposed Copper Bulb or\nWaxed Weathered Copper Bulb or\nWaxed Oxidized Copper Bulb Block of Copper or\nExposed Copper or\nWeathered Copper or\nOxidized Copper or\nWaxed Block of Copper or\nWaxed Exposed Copper or\nWaxed Weathered Copper or\nWaxed Oxidized Copper +\nBlaze Rod +\nRedstone Dust\n\n4\nCopper Grate or\nExposed Copper Grate or\nWeathered Copper Grate or\nOxidized Copper Grate or\nWaxed Copper Grate or\nWaxed Exposed Copper Grate or\nWaxed Weathered Copper Grate or\nWaxed Oxidized Copper Grate Block of Copper or\nExposed Copper or\nWeathered Copper or\nOxidized Copper or\nWaxed Block of Copper or\nWaxed Exposed Copper or\nWaxed Weathered Copper or\nWaxed Oxidized Copper\n\n4\nCopper Ingot Block of Copper or\nWaxed Block of Copper\n\n9\nCut Copper or\nExposed Cut Copper or\nWeathered Cut Copper or\nOxidized Cut Copper or\nWaxed Cut Copper or\nWaxed Exposed Cut Copper or\nWaxed Weathered Cut Copper or\nWaxed Oxidized Cut Copper Block of Copper or\nExposed Copper or\nWeathered Copper or\nOxidized Copper or\nWaxed Block of Copper or\nWaxed Exposed Copper or\nWaxed Weathered Copper or\nWaxed Oxidized Copper\n\n4\nStonecutting[edit | edit source]\nName Ingredients\n[hide]\nCutting recipe\nUnwaxed Cut Copper or\nWaxed Cut Copper Matching Unwaxed Block of Copper or\nMatching Waxed Block of Copper\n4\nUnwaxed Cut Copper Slab or\nWaxed Cut Copper Slab Matching Unwaxed Block of Copper or\nMatching Waxed Block of Copper\n8\nUnwaxed Cut Copper Stairs or\nWaxed Cut Copper Stairs Matching Unwaxed Block of Copper or\nMatching Waxed Block of Copper\n4\nUnwaxed Chiseled Copper or\nWaxed Chiseled Copper Matching Unwaxed Block of Copper or\nMatching Waxed Block of Copper\n4\nUnwaxed Copper Grate or\nWaxed Copper Grate Matching Unwaxed Block of Copper or\nMatching Waxed Block of Copper\n4\nOxidation[edit | edit source]\nMain article: Oxidation\nNon-waxed blocks of copper have four stages of oxidation (including the initial normal state). Lightning bolts and axes can remove the oxidation from blocks of copper. They can be waxed with a honeycomb to prevent the oxidation from progressing.\nAs the block begins to oxidize (exposed copper), it gets discolored and green spots begin to appear. As the oxidation continues (weathered copper), the block is a green color with brown spots. In the last stage (oxidized copper), the block is teal with several green spots.\nSounds[edit | edit source]\nGeneric[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition:\n[hide]\nv t e\ncopper sound type\nSound

This is a reference to Achievement Hunter's Let's Play Minecraft series, in which this combination is used to create the \"Tower of Pimps\" (seen right), a structure first created by Gavin Free, which is now used in many episodes as a trophy.\nIf one block is considered to be equal to one cubic meter, then one block of gold has a mass of 19,320 kilograms, making it the heaviest real-world matter available in vanilla Minecraft if element blocks are not considered. A player's inventory has 37 slots (including the offhand slot), and each can carry 64 blocks of gold; therefore, a player can carry a maximum number of 45,749.76 metric tons of weight, not considering armor or putting things in shulker boxes (theoretically increasing the weight by 27 times).\nExternal links[edit | edit source]\nBlock of the Week: Gold – Minecraft.net on February 17, 2017\nNavigation[edit | edit source]\n[hide]\nv t e\nGold\nMaterial Ore Deepslate Ore Raw Raw Block Nether Ore Nugget Ingot Block\nArmor Helmet Chestplate Leggings Boots Horse Armor\nTools Pickaxe Axe Shovel Sword Hoe\nMiscellaneous Gilded Blackstone Carrot Apple Enchanted Apple Element\nApril Fools' jokes Chest Poisonous Potato Enchanted Poisonous Potato Potone Ore\n[hide]\nv t e\nBlocks\n[hide]\nStructural\nWood/Hypha Logs Stripped Wood Stripped Stems Stripped Hyphae Stripped Block of Bamboo Stripped Bamboo Mosaic Planks\nStone-based Stone Cobblestone Mossy Smooth Stone Stone Bricks Chiseled Cracked Mossy Granite Polished Diorite Polished Andesite Polished Deepslate Chiseled Cobbled Polished Deepslate Bricks Cracked Deepslate Tiles Cracked Tuff Chiseled Polished Tuff Bricks Chiseled\nFrom the Overworld Bricks Packed Mud Mud Bricks Block of Resin Resin Bricks Chiseled Sandstone Chiseled Cut Smooth Red Sandstone Chiseled Cut Smooth Prismarine Bricks Dark\nThe Nether Netherrack Nether Bricks Chiseled Cracked Red Blackstone Polished Blackstone Chiseled Polished Blackstone Bricks Cracked Basalt Polished Smooth\nThe End End Stone Bricks Purpur Block Pillar\nStructural minerals Block of Quartz Bricks Chiseled Pillar Smooth Block of Copper Chiseled Cut Grate\nDecorative minerals Block of Amethyst Block of Coal Block of Diamond Block of Emerald Block of Gold Block of Iron Block of Lapis Lazuli Block of Netherite Block of Redstone\n[show]\nOrnamental\n[show]\nNatural\n[show]\nUtility\n[show]\nCreative or commands only\n[show]\nUnused\n[show]\nUnimplemented\n[show]\nJoke features\n[show]\nRemoved",

Unlike obsidian, blocks of netherite (and ancient debris) can be moved with pistons, which makes it useful in redstone builds. Furthermore, blocks of netherite have a hardness of 50, the same hardness as obsidian, crying obsidian, and respawn anchors. This makes it the hardest block to be able to be pushed by a piston. However, these blocks can be destroyed by explosions while being pushed or pulled by pistons.‌[Java Edition only][1] They can also be destroyed by explosions when in item form.[2]\nIt can be destroyed by a wither's blue skulls and on contact with a wither.\nBeacons[edit | edit source]\nBlocks of netherite can be used to power a beacon. The beacon can be powered by a 3×3 square of netherite blocks underneath it, and can also optionally include a 5×5, 7×7 and 9×9 layer in the shape of a pyramid under the original layer to increase the effects from the beacon. The layers do not have to be entirely netherite blocks, as any combination of blocks of iron, blocks of gold, blocks of diamond, blocks of emerald, or netherite blocks can power a beacon.\nCrafting ingredient[edit | edit source]\nName Ingredients\n[hide]\nCrafting recipe\nNetherite Ingot Block of Netherite\n\n9\nSounds[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition:\n[hide]\nv t e\nnetherite_block sound type\nSound Subtitles Source Description Resource location Translation key Volume Pitch Attenuation\ndistance\nBlock broken Blocks Once the block has broken block.netherite_block.break subtitles.block.generic.break 0.95 0.8/0.72 16\nBlock placed Blocks When the block is placed block.netherite_block.place subtitles.block.generic.place 0.95 0.8/0.72 16\nBlock breaking Blocks While the block is in the process of being broken block.netherite_block.hit subtitles.block.generic.hit 0.25 0.5 16\nSomething falls on a block Entity-Dependent Falling on the block with fall damage block.netherite_block.fall subtitles.block.generic.fall 0.5 0.75 16\nFootsteps Entity-Dependent Walking on the block block.netherite_block.step subtitles.block.generic.footsteps 0.15 1.0 16\nBedrock Edition:\n[hide]\nv t e\nnetherite sound type\nSound Source Description Resource location Volume Pitch\nBlocks Once the block has broken dig.netherite 1.0 0.8-1.0\nBlocks When the block is placed dig.netherite 1.0 0.8-1.0\nBlocks While the block is in the process of being broken hit.netherite 0.3 0.5\nPlayers Falling on the block with fall damage fall.netherite 0.4 1.0\nPlayers Walking on the block step.netherite 0.21 1.0\nBlocks Jumping from the block jump.netherite 0.14 1.0\nBlocks Falling on the block without fall damage land.netherite 0.16 1.0\nData values[edit | edit source]\nID[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition:\nName Identifier Form Block tags\n[hide]\nTranslation key\nBlock of Netherite netherite_block Block & Item beacon_base_blocks\nmineable/pickaxe\nneeds_diamond_tool\nblock.minecraft.netherite_block\nBedrock Edition:\nName Identifier Numeric ID Form Item ID[i 1]\n[hide]\nTranslation key\nBlock of Netherite netherite_block 525 Block & Giveable Item[i 2] Identical[i 3]\ntile.netherite_block.name\n↑ ID of block's direct item form, which is used in savegame files and addons.\n↑ Available with /give command.\n↑ The block's direct item form has the same ID as the block.\nHistory[edit | edit source]\n[hide]\nJava Edition\n1.16 20w06a Added blocks of netherite.\n20w07a Blocks of netherite can now be used as part of a beacon base.\n[hide]\nBedrock Edition\n1.16.0 beta 1.16.0.51 Added blocks of netherite.\nbeta 1.16.0.57 Blocks of netherite can now be used as part of a beacon base.\n1.20.30 Preview 1.20.20.21 Increased the blast resistance of blocks of netherite from 720 to 1,200.\nIssues[edit | edit source]\nIssues relating to \"Block of Netherite\" are maintained on the bug tracker.

It can also be used as storage if the player's inventory is full of redstone dust from mining.\nCrafting ingredient[edit | edit source]\nBlocks of redstone can be crafted back into redstone dust, and thus provide compact storage for redstone, like other blocks of materials (block of iron, block of gold, etc.).\nName Ingredients\n[hide]\nCrafting recipe\nRedstone Dust Block of Redstone\n\n9\nRedstone component[edit | edit source]\nA block of redstone powers dust and repeaters, deactivates attached torches, and activate mechanisms (left) – but does not power adjacent opaque blocks (right).\nSee also: Redstone circuit\nTo place a block of redstone, use the Place Block control.\nBlocks of redstone are always active and cannot be turned off. A block of redstone:\npowers any adjacent redstone dust, including above or below, to power level 15\npowers any adjacent redstone comparators or redstone repeaters facing away from the block of redstone to power level 15\nactivates any adjacent mechanism components (doors, redstone lamps, etc.), including above or below, with the exception of pistons, which cannot be activated by any power source directly in front of them\nAdjacent opaque blocks are not powered.\nIf a redstone torch is attached to a block of redstone, it deactivates after 1 redstone tick and does not reactivate (which is normal behavior for a redstone torch attached to a powered block).\nA block of redstone can be moved by a piston.

        "content": "Some of the most common blocks in Minecraft, clockwise from the left: stone, sand, dirt, and grass.\nBlocks are the basic units of structure in Minecraft that make up the game's world. Many blocks can be collected and placed anywhere, as well as be used as helpful resources.\nContents\n1 Behavior\n2 Block height\n3 Textures\n4 List of blocks\n4.1 Technical blocks\n4.2 Education Edition Exclusive\n4.3 Removed blocks\n4.3.1 Outright removed blocks\n4.3.2 Removed through substitution\n4.3.3 Extreme metadata variants\n4.4 Joke blocks\n5 Videos\n6 History\n6.1 Block additions and removals\n6.2 Block model additions\n6.3 Other changes\n6.4 April Fools blocks\n7 Issues\n8 Trivia\n9 Gallery\n9.1 Screenshots\n9.2 In other media\n10 See also\n11 References\n12 Navigation\nBehavior[edit | edit source]\nA variety of different blocks occurring in an underwater coral reef; sand can be seen lining the ground, cut sandstone in underwater ruin structures and various forms of coral.\nBlocks are arranged in a 3-dimensional grid of 1-cubic-meter cells, although some blocks appear to occupy a partial cell; these include slabs, snow layers, ladders, vines, stairs, turtle eggs, and sea pickles, among others.\nCollectively, blocks and fluids make up the in-game environment, and most can be harvested and utilized in various fashions. Some blocks, such as dirt and sandstone, are opaque and occupy their entire cubic meter, while others, such as glass and flowers, are transparent or non-solid. Explosions destroy some blocks more easily than they destroy others, while some are virtually immune to explosions. They can still be theoreticlly exploded.\nAir is a special block that acts as a substitute for the absence of blocks. It has two variants: cave air and void air.‌[Java Edition only]\nSome blocks, such as sea lanterns and glowstone, emit light, the amount of which varies widely; see this table of light values for further information. Opaque blocks completely block light, while transparent blocks have no effect on light, block the light, or merely weaken it.\nAlmost all blocks ignore gravity, except for sand, red sand, gravel, anvils of all damage levels, dragon eggs, all colors of concrete powder, scaffolding, snow layers‌[BE only], pointed dripstone, suspicious sand, and suspicious gravel. These turn into entities when their support is removed.\nWhen broken, blocks emit sounds and particles associated with themselves, except in the following cases:\nWhen the block is removed by a piston.[1]\nIf the block is affected by gravity and falls into an invalid space (If the block is gravity based and drops onto a torch, for example).[2]\nAnvils that are destroyed by running out of durability or falling. Only particles are missing.[3]\nIf the block can be washed away and is washed away by a flowing fluid.[4]\nIf the block can be replaced by other blocks and is replaced.[5]\nIf the block is one of a few blocks such as rails or redstone wire, supported by another block and its supporting block is removed.[6]\nIf the block is leaves and decays.[7]\nBlock height[edit | edit source]\nMain article: Solid block § Height\nMost solid blocks are 1 meter high (3.28084... feet or 1250⁄381 feet), but several blocks have non-standard block heights, such as slabs.\nA player can automatically step up from a lower to a higher height if the difference is at most 0.6 (3⁄5) of a block or 1.9685... feet (250⁄127 feet).\nTextures[edit | edit source]\nMain page: User:Editor31/List of block textures\nThe textures on the faces of most blocks are 16×16 pixels. Exceptions include candles, sculk sensors, etc. Most blocks are proportionately one cubic meter by default, but their shape can be changed using models.\nMost blocks have static textures, but these blocks are animated: water, lava, nether portal, end portal, end gateway, prismarine (slab; stairs; wall), sea lantern, magma block, seagrass, kelp, fire, lantern, lit campfire and their soul variants, lit blast furnace, heat block‌[BE & edu only], stems, hyphae, lit smoker, stonecutter, sculk, sculk shrieker, sculk sensor, calibrated sculk sensor, sculk vein, and command block.\nPlayers can change their textures by changing their files in-game. The following explains how. In the title screen, go to \"Mods and Texture Packs\", then click the texture pack, then click \"Done\".\nIf there is none, click \"Open texture pack folder\". This redirects you to the game directory. If you have a file or folder containing the texture pack, move it here. Go back to the game, exit the menu, and then enter to the \"Mod and Texture Packs\" option again. Your file should now be there. Drag it as described in the first point above.\nUsing texture packs, the player can change the textures and resolution of blocks, including whether their texture is animated. They can also change the shapes of blocks using models and the size of blocks to any size with equal width and height, though sizes that are a power of two tend to work better.\nList of blocks[edit |

Muut käytöt, katso Projects/Finnish translation/Kuutio (täsmennyssivu).\nTälle aiheelle on luokka! \nKatso Category:Finnish translation/Kuutiot, lista aiheeseen liittyvistä sivuista.\nJoitain Minecraftin yleisimpiä kuutioita, myötäpäivään vasemmalta: kivi, hiekka, multa ja ruoho.\nKuutiot ovat Minecraftin rakenteen perusyksiköitä, joista pelimaailma koostuu. Monia kuutioita voi kerätä ja asettaa minne tahansa ja käyttää hyödyllisinä resursseina.\nContents\n1 Käyttäytyminen\n2 Kuution korkeus\n3 Tekstuurit\n4 Luettelo kuutioista\n4.1 Technical blocks\n4.2 Education Edition Exclusive\n4.3 Removed blocks\n4.3.1 Outright removed blocks\n4.3.2 Removed through substitution\n4.3.3 Extreme metadata variants\n4.4 Joke blocks\n5 Videos\n6 History\n6.1 Block additions and removals\n6.2 Block model additions\n6.3 Other changes\n6.4 April Fools blocks\n7 Issues\n8 Trivia\n9 Gallery\n9.1 Screenshots\n9.2 In other media\n10 See also\n11 References\n12 Navigation\nKäyttäytyminen[edit source]\nValikoima eri kuutioita, joita löytyy vedenalaiselta koralliriutalta. Hiekka muodostaa maanpinnan, leikattu hiekkakivi vedenalaisten raunioiden rakenteessa ja korallin eri muotoja.\nKuutiot ovat järjestäytyneet 3-ulotteiseen ruudukkoon, joka koostuu 1 kuutiometrin soluista, vaikka jotkin kuutiot näyttävät täyttävän osittaisen solun. Näihin kuuluvat laatat, lumikerrokset, tikkaat, köynnökset, portaat, kilpikonnan munat, tulitelat sekä monia muita.\nYhdessä kuutiot ja nesteet moudostavat pelin ympäristön ja suurinta osaa niistä voi kerätä ja hyödyntää eri tarkoituksiin. Jotkin kuutiot, kuten multa ja hiekkakivi ovat opaakkisia ja täyttävät koko kuutiometrinsä, kun taas toiset, kuten lasi ja kukat ovat läpinäkyviä tai ei-sileitä. Räjähdykset tuhoavat joitain kuutioita helpommin kuin toisia, kun taas jotkin ovat itse asiassa immuuneja räjähdyksille. Ne voidaan kuitenkin teoriassa räjäyttää.\nIlma on erikoiskuutio, joka vastaa kuution puuttumista. Sillä on kaksi varianttia: luolailma ja tyhjiöilma.‌[vain Java Edition]\nJotkin kuutiot, kuten merilyhdyt ja hehkukivi tuottavat valoa, jonka määrä vaihtelee paljon, katso tämä taulukko valoarvoista saadaksesi lisää tietoa. Opaakkiset kuutiot estävät valon kokonaan, kun taas läpinäkyvillä kuutioilla ei ole vaikutusta valoon, ne estävät valon tai pelkästään heikentävät sitä.\nMelkein kaikki kuutiot eivät huomioi painovoimaa, poikkeuksena hiekka, punahiekka, sora, kaikkien vahinkotasojen alasimet, lohikäärmeen munat, kaikenväriset betonijauheet, rakennustelineet, lumikerrokset‌[vain BE], terävä tippukivi, epäilyttävä hiekka ja epäilyttävä sora. Nämä muuttuvat olioiksi, kun niiden tuki poistuu.\nTuhoutuessaan kuutiot tuottavat niihin liittyviä ääniä ja partikkeleita pitsi seuraavissa tilanteissa:\nKun mäntä poistaa kuution.[1]\nJos painovoima vaikuttaa kuutioon ja se tippuu virheelliseen tilaan (Esim. jos painovoima vaikuttaa kuutioon ja se tippuu soihdun päälle).[2]\nAlasimet, jotka tuhoutuvat kestävyyden loppumisesta tai tippumisesta. Vain partikkelit puuttuvat.[3]\nJos kuutio voi huuhtoutua ja virtaava neste huuhtoo sen.[4]\nJos kuution voi korvata muilla kuutioilla ja se korvataan.[5]\nJos kuutio on yksi muutamista kuutioista, kuten raiteet tai redstone-johto, jota toinen kuutio tukee ja sitä tukeva kuutio poistetaan.[6]\nJos kuutio on lehdet ja mädäntyy.[7]\nKuution korkeus[edit source]\nPääartikkeli: Sileä kuutio § Korkeus\nSuurin osa sileistä kuutioista on 1 metrin korkuisia (3,28084... jalkaa tai 1250⁄381 jalkaa), mutta useilla kuutioilla on ei-standardikuutiokorkeuksia, kuten laatoilla.\nPelaaja voi automaattisesti nousta alemmalta ylemmälle korkeudelle, jos ero on enintään 0,6 (3⁄5) kuutiota tai 1,9685... jalkaa (250⁄127 jalkaa).\nTekstuurit[edit source]\nPääartikkeli: Luettelo kuutioiden tekstuureista\nSuurimman osan kuutioista sivujen tekstuurit ovat 16x16 pikseliä. Poikkeuksena kynttilät, sculk-sensorit, yms. Suurin osa kuutioista on oletuksena yksi kuutiometri, mutta niiden muotoa voi muuttaa käyttämällä malleja\nSuurimmalla osalla kuutioista on staattiset tekstuurit, mutta seuraavat kuutiot ovat animoituja: vesi, laava, nether-portaali, end-portaali, end-portti, prismariini (laatta, portaat, muuri), merilyhty, magmakuutio, meriruoho, rakkolevä, tuli, lyhty, palava nuotio ja sen sieluvariantti, palava masuuni, lämpökuutio‌[vain BE & edu], rungot, rihma, palava savustin, kivileikkuri, sculk, sculk-kirkuja, sculk-sensori, kalibroitu sculk-sensori, sculk-suoni ja komentokuutio.\nPelaajat voivat vaihtaa tekstuurejaan vaihtamalla niiden tiedostoja pelissä. Seuraava kertoo, miten. Valikossa valitse \"Asetukset\" ja sitten \"Resurssipaketit\". Kaksi paneelia ilmestyy: \"Saatavilla\" ja \"Valittuna\"(Oletus-resurssipaketin tulisi olla \"Valittuna\" alla).\nJos joku resurssipaketti on kohdassa \"Saatavilla\", vedä se kohtaan \"Valittuna\" ja klikkaa sitten \"Valmis\" Resurssipaketin tulisi olla aktiivisena hetken päästä.\nJos siellä ei ole mitään, klikkaa \"Avaa pakettikansio\". Tämä uudelleenohjaa sinut pelihakemistoon. Jos sinulla on resurssipaketin sisältävä tiedosto tai kansio, siirrä se tänne. Palaa peliin, poistu valikosta ja valitse \"Resurssipaketit\"-valinta uudestaan. Tiedostosi pitäisi olla nyt siellä. Vedä se yllä olevan ensimmäisen kohdan ohjeiden mukaan.\nResurssipaketteja käyttämällä pelaaja voi vaihtaa kuutioiden tekstuureja ja resoluutioita mukaan lukien, onko tekstuuri animoitu vai ei. He voivat myös muuttaa kuutioiden muotoja käyttämällä malleja ja kuutioiden kokoa miksi tahansa samalla leveydellä ja korkeudella, vaikka ko'oilla, jotka ovat kahden potensseja, on tapana toimia paremmin.\nLuettelo kuutioista[edit source]\nAkaasianappi\nAkaasiaovi\nAkaasia-aita\nAkaasiaportti\nRoikkuva akaasiakyltti\nAkaasianlehdet\nAkaasiahalko\nAkaasialankut\nAkaasiapainelaatta\nAkaasian

Medurs ifrån vänster: sten, sand, jord, and gräs.\nBlock är de grundläggande strukturenheterna i Minecraft som utgör spelets värld. Många block kan samlas och placeras vart som helst och även användas som användbara resurser.\nContents\n1 Beteende\n2 Block höjd\n3 Texturer\n4 List of blocks\n4.1 Technical blocks\n4.2 Education Edition Exclusive\n4.3 Removed blocks\n4.3.1 Outright removed blocks\n4.3.2 Removed through substitution\n4.3.3 Extreme metadata variants\n4.4 Joke blocks\n5 Videos\n6 History\n6.1 Block additions and removals\n6.2 Block model additions\n6.3 Other changes\n6.4 April Fools blocks\n7 Issues\n8 Trivia\n9 Gallery\n9.1 Screenshots\n9.2 In other media\n10 See also\n11 References\n12 Navigation\nBeteende[edit source]\nEn mängd olika block som förekommer i ett undervattenskorallrev; sand kan ses längs med marken, skuren sandsten i undervattensruinstrukturer och diverse former av koraller.\nBlock är arrangerade i ett Tredimensionellt rutnät av 1 kubikmeters celler, även om vissa block verkar delvis ockupera en cell; dessa omfattar plattor, snö lager, stegar, klätterväxter, trappor, sköldpaddsägg och havsgurkor med flera.\n\nTillsammans utgör block och vätskor spelmiljön och de flesta kan skördas och utnyttjas på olika sätt. Vissa block, såsom jord och sandsten, är ogenomskinliga och ockuperar hela deras kubikmeter. Medan andra, såsom glas och blommor. är transparenta eller icke fast. Explosioner förstör vissa block enklare än andra, medans vissa är så gott som imuna imot explosioner. De kan fortfarande teoretiskt sätt exploderas med en tillräckligt stark explosion.\nLuft är ett specielt block som agerar som en ersättning för frånvaron av block. Den har two varianter: grottluft och tomluft.[Endast Java Edition]\nVissa block, såsom havslyktor och glödsten, ger ifrån sig ljust där mängden av ljus varierar kraftigt; kolla på denna tabell av ljusvärden för mer information. Ogenomskinliga block blockerar ljus helt och hållet medans transparenta block har ingen verkan på ljus, blockerar ljuset eller endast försämrar det.\nNästan alla block ignorerar gravitation, förutom sand, röd sand, grus, städ av alla skade nivåer, drakägg, alla färger av betongpulver, byggnadsställning, snö lager[Endast BE], spetsig droppsten, misstänksam sand och misstänksamt grus. Dessa omvandlas till entiteter när deras stöd är borttaget.\nNär blocken går sönder avger de ljud och partiklar förknippade med sig själva, förutom i följande fall:\nNär blocket är borttaget av en kolv.[1]\nOm blocket är påverkat av gravitation och faller in i ett ogiltigt utrymme (Om blocket är gravitations baserad och faller på en fackla till exempel).[2]\nStäd som är förstörda genom att få slut på hållbarhet eller att falla. Endast partiklar fattas.[3]\nOm blocket kan sköljas bort och är bortsköljd av en strömmande vätska.[4]\nOm blocket kan ersättas av andra block och är ersatt.[5]\nOm blocket är ett av några få block såsom räls eller redstonetråd, stöds av ett annat block och dess stödblock tas bort.[6]\nOm blocket är löv och sönderfaller.[7]\nBlock höjd[edit source]\nHuvudartikel: Fast block § Höjd\nDe flästa fasta block är 1 meter höga (3,28084... fot eller 1250/381 fot), men ett flertal block har ej standard blockhöjd, såsom plattor.\nEn spelare kan automatiskt gå upp från en lägre till en högre höjd om skillnaden är som mest 0,6 (3/5) av ett block eller 1,9685... fot (250/127 fot).\n\nTexturer[edit source]\nHuvudartikel: Lista över blocktexturer\nTexturerna på sidorna av de flesta block är 16x16 pixlar. Undantag inkluderar stearinljus, sculksensorer etc. De flesta block är proportionellt en kubikmeter som standard men deras form kan ändras med användning av modeller.\nDe flesta block har stillastående texturer, medans dessa är animerade: vatten, lava, netherportal, endportal, endpassage, prismarin (platta, trappa, mur), havslyckta, magmablock, kelp, eld, lyckta, tänd lägereld och dess själ varianter, tänd masugn, värmeblock[Endast BE & edu], stammar, hyfer, tänd rökugn, stenskärare, sculk, skulkskrikare, sculksensor, kalibrerad sculksensor, sculkven och kommandoblock.\nSpelare kan ändra deras texturer genom att ändra på deras filer i spelet. Följande förklarar hur. I menyn gå till \"Alternativ\", sedan välj \"Resurspaket\" alternativet. Två paneler visas: \"Tillgängliga\" och \"Valda\" (Standard resurspaketet borde vara under \"Valda\").\nOm det finns något resurspaket under \"Tillgängliga\" dra det till \"Valda\", tryck sedan på \"Klar\". Resurspaketet borde vara aktivt innom något ögonblick.\nOm det inte finns några tryck på \"Öppna mappen för paket\". Detta omdirigerar dig till spelkatalogen. Om du har en fil eller map som innnehåller resurspaketet flytta det hit. Gå tillbaks till spelet, lämna menyn och sedan gå in i \"Resurspaket\" alternativet igen. Din fil borde nu vara där. Dra den som beskrivet i första punkten åvan.\nMed användning av resurspaket så kan spelaren ändra texturen och upplösningen av block, inklusive om deras textur är animerad. Man kan också ändra formen av block med använding av modeller och storleken av block till vilken som helst med samma bredd och höjd, men storlekar som är en potens av två tenderar att fungera bättre.\nList of blocks[edit source]\nAcacia Button\nAcacia Door\nAcacia Fence\nAcacia Fence Gate\nAcacia Hanging Sign\nAcacia Leaves\nAcacia Log\nAcacia Planks\nAcacia Pressure Plate\nAcacia

It also generates as piles in some snowy plains village houses, and in ancient cities. Rarely, an iceberg generates entirely made of blue ice.\nGenerated loot[edit | edit source]\nItem Structure Container Quantity\n[hide]\nChance\nJava Edition and Bedrock Edition\nBlue Ice Village Snowy house chest 1 9.9%\nCrafting[edit | edit source]\nIngredients\n[hide]\nCrafting recipe\nPacked Ice\n\nIt takes 81 regular ice made into packed ice to create a single blue ice block.\nTrading[edit | edit source]\nWandering traders have 1⁄6 chance to sell blue ice for 6 emeralds.\nUsage[edit | edit source]\nBlue ice is slippery, causing most entities to slide, including items. It is even more slippery (0.989) than ice or packed ice (0.98). This allows for increased speed of items in water currents by placing the blue ice under the water current. Mobs do not travel faster in water currents on blue ice.\nBoats can travel even faster on blue ice than on either normal ice or packed ice, being able to reach a top speed of 72.73 m/s (as opposed to 40 m/s on ice and packed ice). Ice tracks built from blue ice, packed ice, or a combination are useful for long-range travel in all three dimensions.\nBlue ice is a completely solid block and allows the placement of any objects on top.\nUnlike normal ice, blue ice does not melt when placed near light sources.\nBlue ice can be used to create basalt. When lava flows into a space above soul soil and next to blue ice, basalt is formed. This can be used in a basalt generator.\nBlue ice is not a storage block, as it cannot be crafted back into packed ice.\nSounds[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition:\n[hide]\nv t e\nglass sound type\nSound Subtitles Source Description Resource location Translation key Volume Pitch Attenuation\ndistance\nBlock broken Blocks Once the block has broken block.glass.break subtitles.block.generic.break 1.0 0.8 16\nBlock placed Blocks When the block is placed block.glass.place subtitles.block.generic.place 1.0 0.8 16\nBlock breaking Blocks While the block is in the process of being broken block.glass.hit subtitles.block.generic.hit 0.25 0.5 16\nSomething falls on a block Entity-Dependent Falling on the block with fall damage block.glass.fall subtitles.block.generic.fall 0.5 0.75 16\nFootsteps Entity-Dependent Walking on the block block.glass.step subtitles.block.generic.footsteps 0.15 1.0 16\nBedrock Edition:\n[hide]\nv t e\nglass sound type\nSound Source Description Resource location Volume Pitch\nBlocks Once the block has broken random.glass 1.0 0.8-1.0\nBlocks When the block is placed dig.stone 1.0 0.8-1.0\nBlocks While the block is in the process of being broken hit.stone 0.4 0.6\nPlayers Falling on the block with fall damage fall.stone 0.4 1.0\nPlayers Walking on the block step.stone 0.3 1.0\nBlocks Jumping from the block jump.stone 0.12 1.0\nBlocks Falling on the block without fall damage land.stone 0.22 1.0\n\nData values[edit | edit source]\nID[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition:\nName Identifier Form Block tags\n[hide]\nTranslation key\nBlue Ice blue_ice Block & Item ice\nmineable/pickaxe\ngeode_invalid_blocks\nblock.minecraft.blue_ice\nBedrock Edition:\nName Identifier Numeric ID Form Item ID[i 1]\n[hide]\nTranslation key\nBlue Ice blue_ice 266 Block & Giveable Item[i 2] Identical[i 3]\n(Numeric: -11)\ntile.blue_ice.name\n↑ ID of block's direct item form, which is used in savegame files and addons.\n↑ Available with /give command.\n↑ The block's direct item form has the same ID as the block.\nHistory[edit | edit source]\n[hide]\nJava Edition\n1.13 18w15a Added blue ice.\nBlue ice generates on the bottom of icebergs in frozen ocean biomes.\n18w16a Blue ice slipperiness has been changed from 0.999 to 0.989\npre2 Blue ice is now renewable, as its crafting ingredient, packed ice, can now be crafted from normal ice.\n1.14 18w49a Blue ice now generates in the updated snowy tundra villages.\n19w05a Added wandering traders, which sell blue ice.\n1.15 19w41a Blue ice is now only slippery through non-full blocks that are 0.5 blocks tall or less.

No tool or explosion can damage them (they act as if they have no collision box when the player tries).\nUsage[edit | edit source]\nBorder blocks are generally used to surround an area to prevent students (or players) and mobs from entering it, or to confine them within the surrounded area. They create an invisible, impassable barrier of infinite height above and below themselves (but not sideways). They prevent players who lack the worldbuilder ability from doing any of the following:\nJumping, climbing, tunneling, or swimming over or under them,\nWalking through them,\nBuilding (placing or destroying blocks) over or under them,\nDestroying the border block.\nMost mobs cannot pass over or under border blocks and cannot target a player or other mob through them. However, they do not stop the ender dragon. Weapons, projectiles, and explosions interact with them as if they were regular walls. Because of this, it is possible to use an ender pearl, chorus fruit, or rideable entity on the other side, to cross one.\nPlacing or breaking a border block requires the worldbuilder or operator‌[Bedrock Edition only] ability, which can be granted to the player by an operator or host.

This book can be thrown into a nether portal to create a funky portal.\nThe random books are tied to the block such that using the same block multiple times always returns an identical book. The title of the random books given by the block is correlated with the location of the block. The title's pattern takes the format <chunk X>/<chunk Z>/<block orientation>/<distance to the chunk's edge to the right of the block>/<block Y>, so books from the same block always has the same title and content.\nThe author of every book is \"Universe itself\", obfuscated, and every book has 16 pages filled with random text.

Their interface can be opened by pressing use on them.\nBrewing stands need blaze powder as fuel. Each piece brews 20 batches of potions, with each stage of brewing counting separately. Unlike furnaces, there is no time limit; fuel is consumed only when there are water bottles and an ingredient to brew into it.\nBrewing stands interact with hoppers as follows:\nThey accept brewing ingredients from hoppers pointing down into the top.\nAny valid brewing ingredient is pushed into the ingredient slot, regardless of whether it would actually start the brewing process.\nAny valid potion recipe can be preloaded for \"hands-free\" brewing of a complex recipe, with the nether wart falling through into the stand for the first step.\nBottles (including empty bottles) and fuel are accepted from hoppers pointing into the side.\nFinished products can be pulled out by hoppers below, but each stage of brewing counts as a batch of \"finished\" potions.\nIn Minecraft Education, elements can be combined in the brewing stand to make the medicine potions: antidote, elixir, eye drops, and tonic.\nProfession[edit | edit source]\nMain article: Job site block\nIf a brewing stand has not been claimed by a villager, any nearby unemployed villager has a chance to change their profession to cleric and claim the brewing stand as their job site block.\nLight source[edit | edit

(Click to see the animation)\nWhirlpool bubble columns appear naturally when magma blocks generate underwater, in clusters on the floor of aquifers, or as part of ocean ruins and ruined portals generated below the water surface.\nPost-generation[edit | edit source]\nWhen a magma block is placed underwater, a whirlpool bubble column is generated.\nWhen soul sand is placed under source water blocks, an upward bubble column is generated.\nA bubble column is created 20 game ticks after placing a magma block or soul sand, and is destroyed 5 game ticks after destroying the magma block or soul sand. A bubble column is created or destroyed in all water source blocks of the bubble column simultaneously.\nUsage[edit | edit source]\nPlayers and air-breathing mobs can enter a bubble column to replenish their air supply, at the same speed that they would when they leave the water entirely. The slower mining speed when underwater, however, still applies to players inside bubble columns. Water-breathing mobs avoid bubble columns because they suffocate if trapped in one. A bubble column is destroyed when moved by a piston. Bubble columns propagate only through water source blocks, stopping at any flowing water or waterlogged block. The height of a bubble column is limited only by the water's surface or by any obstructing blocks underwater.\nBubble columns cannot be created in downward flowing water.[1] This can be circumvented by placing kelp in downward-flowing water, which converts it into a source block.\nWhirlpool[edit | edit source]\nA whirlpool, or downward bubble column, is the only type that naturally generates in the Overworld, often originating from magma at the bottom of underwater canyons. A whirlpool can be identified by the presence of air bubbles wandering downward. They drag entities downward. A boat ridden over a whirlpool shakes and eventually sinks if kept above the whirlpool for too long.\nUpward[edit | edit source]\nUpward bubble columns can be identified by the presence of vertically rising air bubbles. An upward bubble column accelerates entities upward. The longer an object rises through the bubble column, the faster it travels. At high enough speeds, players and entities can be launched out of water by several blocks. Sitting on the surface above a rising bubble column causes entities to bounce upward repeatedly by about 1 block.\nTransport[edit | edit source]\nIn Java Edition, entities move at a speed of approximately 11 blocks per second when in an upward bubble column, or 4.9 blocks per second when in a downward bubble column.\nIn Bedrock Edition, entities move at a speed of approximately 8 blocks per second when in an upward bubble column, or 6 blocks per second when in a downward bubble column.\nRedstone component[edit | edit source]\nAn observer can detect when a bubble column is created or destroyed in a water source block.\nEnder pearl stasis chamber[edit | edit source]\nProjectiles such as ender pearls are affected by bubble columns. An ender pearl can remain afloat on top of an upward bubble column, allowing it to be stored indefinitely. A mechanism can then be triggered to make the ender pearl hit a solid surface (e.g. by closing a trapdoor), teleporting the thrower back to the setup wherever they are.\nSounds[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition\n[hide]\nSounds\nSound Subtitles Source Description Resource location Translation key Volume Pitch Attenuation\ndistance\nBubbles pop None Unused sound event[sound 1] block.bubble_column.bubble_pop subtitles.block.bubble_column.bubble_pop 0.1 1.0 16\nBubbles flow Blocks Randomly from an upward bubble column block.bubble_column.upwards_ambient subtitles.block.bubble_column.upwards_ambient 0.12-0.24 0.9-1.05 16\nBubbles woosh Players When a player enters an upward bubble column block.bubble_column.upwards_inside subtitles.block.bubble_column.upwards_inside 0.7 1.0 16\nBubbles whirl Blocks Randomly from a downward bubble column block.bubble_column.whirlpool_ambient subtitles.block.bubble_column.whirlpool_ambient 0.12-0.25 0.9-1.05 16\nBubbles zoom Players When a player enters a downward bubble column block.bubble_column.whirlpool_inside subtitles.block.bubble_column.whirlpool_inside 0.7 1.0 16\n↑ MC-132067\nBedrock Edition:\n[hide]\nSounds\nSound Source Description Resource location Volume Pitch\nBlocks ? bubble.pop 0.4-0.6 0.9-1.05\nBlocks Randomly from an upward bubble column bubble.up 0.4-0.6 0.9-1.05\nBlocks When a player enters an upward bubble column bubble.upinside 1.0-1.5 0.9-1.05\nBlocks Randomly from a downward bubble column bubble.down 0.4-0.6 0.9-1.05\nBlocks When a player enters a downward bubble column bubble.downinside 1.0-1.5 0.9-1.05\nData values[edit | edit source]\nID[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition:\nName Identifier Form\n[hide]\nTranslation key\nBubble Column bubble_column Block\nblock.minecraft.bubble_column\nBedrock Edition:\nName Identifier Numeric ID Form Item ID[i 1]\n[hide]\nTranslation key\nBubble Column bubble_column 415 Block & Ungiveable Item[i 2] Identical[i 3]\n—\n↑ ID of block's direct item form, which is used in savegame files and addons.\n↑ Unavailable with /give command\n↑ The block's direct item form has the same ID as the block.\nBlock states[edit | edit source]\nSee also: Block states\nJava Edition:\nName Default value Allowed values\n[hide]\nDescription\ndrag true false\ntrue Determines whether the bubble column is upward or whirlpool.\nBedrock Edition:\nName Metadata Bits Default value Allowed values Values for\nMetadata Bits\n[hide]\nDescription\ndrag_down 0x1 false false\ntrue 0\n1 Determines whether the bubble column is upward or whirlpool.\n\nHistory[edit | edit source]\nThere is an associated technical blocks page for the internal item form of this block; see Technical blocks/Bubble Column.\nNovember 18, 2017 Bubble columns were shown in a video clip during MINECON Earth 2017.\n[hide]\nJava Edition\n1.13 18w07a Added bubble columns.\n18w08a Bubble columns now generate in underwater ravines.\n18w09a Bubble columns now generate in ocean ruins.\n18w16a Bubble columns can no longer be pushed by pistons.\n[hide]\nUpcoming Java Edition\n1.21.5 25w02a Bubble columns produce less particles and sounds when entities that are unaffected by them are inside them.\n[hide]\nBedrock Edition\n1.5.0 beta 1.5.0.4 Added bubble columns.\nbeta 1.5.0.7 Bubble columns can now be toggled to look similar to Java Edition, but only for devices that can handle them.\n[hide]\nLegacy Console Edition\nXbox 360 Xbox One PS3 PS4 PS Vita Wii U Switch\nTU69 1.76 1.76 1.76 Patch 38 Added bubble columns.\nIssues[edit | edit source]\nIssues relating to \"Bubble Column\" are maintained on the bug tracker.

For more information, see Breaking § Speed.\nNatural generation[edit | edit source]\nBudding amethyst generates naturally as part of amethyst geodes replacing some blocks of amethyst in the innermost layer of the geode.\nUsage[edit | edit source]\nGrowing into amethyst clusters[edit | edit source]\nAn amethyst bud placed on a budding amethyst (rather than any other block) regardless whether it was placed by the player or spawned by the budding amethyst itself grows over time, going through three growth stages – small, medium, and large – before reaching its 4th and final growth stage as an amethyst cluster, which drops amethyst shards when mined.\nIn Java Edition, the below logic can be applied:\nPer random tick, updates will occur to any given block in the loaded chunk every 68.27 seconds on average if the chunk center is within 128 blocks of a player's location.\nChoose one randomly-selected side of the six-sided block. This random choice is done without considering if growth is possible, so if a direction is chosen that cannot grow an amethyst bud, the random tick does not perform any work.\nThere is a 20% chance to either create a new amethyst bud in air or still water, or to increment the growth stage of an existing amethyst bud, if that bud is attached directly to this block (two adjacent budding amethysts do not speed up growth of a bud between them, as each bud is attached to just one block).\nThere are 4 growth stages.\nAs such, the math can be applied if a player is within random tick range as:\n(68.27 seconds average for random ticks) x (20% chance of growth for any given single side) x (6 sides) x (4 growth stages) = 68.27×5×6×4 = 8192 seconds average, also 2 hours 16 minutes 32 seconds, also 6.827 in-game days.\nSound[edit | edit source]\nUniquely among other blocks a budding amethyst makes a quiet overlay sound when generally interacted with as well as its block breaking sound when hit with a projectile.\nSounds[edit | edit source]\nGeneric[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition:\n[hide]\nv t e\namethyst sound type\nSound Subtitles Source Description Resource location Translation key Volume Pitch Attenuation\ndistance\nBlock broken Blocks Once the block has broken block.amethyst_block.break subtitles.block.generic.break 1.0 0.8 16\nBlock placed Blocks When the block is placed block.amethyst_block.place subtitles.block.generic.place 1.0 0.8 16\nBlock breaking Blocks While the block is in the process of being broken block.amethyst_block.hit subtitles.block.generic.hit 0.25 0.5 16\nSomething falls on a block Entity-Dependent Falling on the block with fall damage block.amethyst_block.fall subtitles.block.generic.fall 0.5 0.75 16\nFootsteps Entity-Dependent Walking on the block block.amethyst_block.step subtitles.block.generic.footsteps 0.15 1.0 16\nBedrock Edition:\n[hide]\nv t e\namethyst_block sound type\nSound Source Description Resource location Volume Pitch\nBlocks Once the block has broken break.amethyst_block 1.0 1.0\nBlocks When the block is placed place.amethyst_block 1.0 1.0\nBlocks While the block is in the process of being broken hit.amethyst_block 1.0 0.5-1.2\nPlayers Falling on the block with fall damage fall.amethyst_block 1.0 1.0\nPlayers Walking on the block step.amethyst_block 1.0 1.0\nPlayers Jumping from the block step.amethyst_block 1.0 1.0\nPlayers Falling on the block without fall damage step.amethyst_block 1.0 1.0\nUnique[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition\n[hide]\nSounds\nSound Subtitles Source Description Resource location Translation key Volume Pitch Attenuation\ndistance\nAmethyst chimes Blocks Walking on the block block.amethyst_block.chime subtitles.block.amethyst_block.chime 0.26-0.2768 0.5-1.784 16\nAmethyst chimes Blocks When a projectile collides with the block block.amethyst_block.chime subtitles.block.amethyst_block.chime 0.2 0.5-1.7 16\nBlock breaking[sound 1] Blocks When a projectile collides with the block block.amethyst_block.hit subtitles.block.generic.hit 0.2 0.5-1.7 16\n↑ This is due to it using the exact same sound event as the one used for breaking - see MC-204050\nBedrock Edition:\n[hide]\nSounds\nSound Source Description Resource location Volume Pitch\nBlocks When stepped on, or when a projectile collides with it chime.amethyst_block 1.0 0.5-1.7\nBlocks When a projectile collides with the block hit.amethyst_block 1.0 1.0\nData values[edit | edit source]\nID[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition:\nName Identifier Form Block tags\n[hide]\nTranslation key\nBudding Amethyst budding_amethyst Block & Item crystal_sound_blocks\nmineable/pickaxe\nblock.minecraft.budding_amethyst\nBedrock Edition:\nName Identifier Numeric ID Form Item ID[i 1]\n[hide]\nTranslation key\nBudding Amethyst budding_amethyst 583 Block & Giveable Item[i 2] Identical[i 3]\ntile.budding_amethyst.name\n↑ ID of block's direct item form, which is used in savegame files and addons.\n↑ Available with /give command.\n↑ The block's direct item form has the same ID as the block.\nHistory[edit | edit source]\nMay 21, 2009 Notch mentioned crystal blocks as a potential block type that can be found in the underground.\nOctober 3, 2020 Amethyst-related blocks are mentioned at Minecraft Live 2020.

This functions in a similar way to the monster spawner.[2]\nAccording to Cory Scheviak, budding amethysts were inspired by atium from the fantasy novel series Mistborn.[3]\nGallery[edit | edit source]\nBudding amethyst with the surrounding amethyst mined away.\nBudding amethyst on artwork for International Women's Day.[4]\nIssues[edit | edit source]\nIssues relating to \"Budding Amethyst\" are maintained on the bug tracker.

Trying to pull it with a sticky piston does nothing.\nUsing a sign on the side of a cactus causes both the sign and the cactus to drop as items.\nNatural generation[edit | edit source]\nCactus naturally occur in desert and badlands biomes (twice more common in desert than in badlands). They generate as one (11⁄18 chance), two (5⁄18 chance), or three (2⁄18 chance) blocks tall. Rarely taller cacti can be found if generation chooses to generate another on top of one already generated (although not as commonly as sugar cane).\nA potted cactus can also be found in an igloo with a basement. Potted cacti and 3 block cactus can also be found in some desert village buildings.\nCacti also have a chance to generate in the entrance chamber of Trial Chambers.\nMob loot[edit | edit source]\nEndermen can pick up cacti. If an enderman is holding a cactus when it dies, the cactus will be dropped.\nGenerated loot[edit | edit source]\nItem Structure Container Quantity\n[hide]\nChance\nJava Edition\nCactus Village Desert house chest 1–4 80.6%\nBedrock Edition\nCactus Bonus Chest Chest 1–2 60%\nVillage Desert house chest 1–4 80.6%\nTrading[edit | edit source]\nWandering traders can sell a cactus for three emeralds.\nUsage[edit | edit source]\nA cactus block may be placed only on sand, red sand, suspicious sand, or another cactus block. A cactus breaks itself (and drops as an item) if any block with a solid material, or lava, occupies any of the 4 horizontally adjacent blocks. It also breaks if on the sand and the block above is water or lava.\nWhen most entities, including players and mobs, touch a cactus, it deals 1HP damage every tick (although damage immunity reduces this to once every half-second). Damage from touching a cactus is reduced by armor, but touching it also damages the armor. Mobs do not avoid cactus when they pathfind. Notably, armor stands are exempt from this.\nA cactus destroys any items that come into contact with it, including other cactus in item form. Falling blocks such as sand and gravel are not destroyed when falling onto cactus; instead, they are transformed into item form (as happens when it falls into any block with a hitbox that has a height less than 1, such as slabs). The item created in this case is sometimes (though not always) destroyed by the cactus. The conversion to an item applies even when the falling block is a cactus (which is possible with /summon).\nWhen a minecart hits a cactus block, the minecart drops as an item and is often destroyed, although a hopper can pick it up faster.\nA cactus can also be placed in a flower pot, where it is rendered harmless.\nA cactus (excluding its spikes) is 7⁄8 of a block in width (the same as chests) and a full block in height, however the collision box is 15⁄16 of a block high.\nFarming[edit | edit source]\nMain article: Tutorials/Cactus farming\nCacti naturally grow to a height of three blocks, adding a block of height when the top cactus block has received 16 random ticks (i.e. on average every 18 minutes, but the actual rate can vary widely). Bone meal does not work on cacti to speed their growth.[2][3]A cactus does not need light to grow and is non-flammable. If a cactus has space directly above it, it grows even if the newly-grown block would immediately break due to adjacent blocks.\n‌In Java Edition 1.21.5 and Bedrock Edition 1.21.70[upcoming] a cactus also has a chance to grow a cactus flower at any height. This happens after a cactus block has received exactly 9 random ticks (i.e. earlier than growing another cactus block)[verify for Bedrock Edition]. If the cactus is 1 or 2 blocks tall the chance is 10%, at 3 or more blocks tall the chance is 25%. A cactus flower can only grow if there are no blocks in any cardinal directly adjacent to it.

A stack of cactus flowers yields an average of 2.74 bone meal.\nPollination[edit | edit source]\nA bee might try to pollinate a cactus flower and collect pollens from it, resulting in the production of either honey or honeycombs at its bee nest. Bees might die this way due to the cactus that often accompanies a cactus flower, which might prick some bees to death during pollination, unless the cactus flower was manually placed by the player on a surface other than cactus.\nSounds[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition:\n[hide]\nv t e\ncactus_flower sound type\nSound Subtitles Source Description Resource location Translation key Volume Pitch Attenuation\ndistance\nBlock broken Blocks Once the block has broken block.cactus_flower.break subtitles.block.generic.break 1.0 0.8 16\nBlock placed Blocks When the block is placed block.cactus_flower.place subtitles.block.generic.place 1.0 0.8 16\nBedrock Edition:\n[hide]\nv t e\ncactus_flower sound type\nSound Source Description Resource location Volume Pitch\nBlocks Once the block has broken break.cactus_flower ? ?\nBlocks When the block is placed place.cactus_flower ? ?\nData values[edit | edit source]\nID[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition:\nName Identifier Form Block tags\n[hide]\nTranslation key\nCactus Flower cactus_flower Block & Item bee_attractive\nflowers\nblock.minecraft.cactus_flower\nBedrock Edition:\nName Identifier Numeric ID Form Item ID[i 1]\n[hide]\nTranslation key\nCactus Flower cactus_flower 1285 Block & Giveable Item[i 2] Identical[i 3]\n(Numeric: -1030)\ntile.cactus_flower.name\n↑ ID of block's direct item form, which is used in savegame files and addons.\n↑ Available with /give command.\n↑ The block's direct item form has the same ID as the block.\nHistory[edit | edit source]\n[hide]\nUpcoming Java Edition\n1.21.5 25w06a Added cactus flowers.\n[hide]\nUpcoming Bedrock Edition\n1.21.70\nExperiment\nDrop 1 2025 Preview 1.21.70.22 Added cactus flowers.\n1.21.70 Preview 1.21.70.23 All features behind the \"Drop 1 2025\" experimental toggle have now been fully implemented.\nIssues[edit | edit source]\nIssues relating to \"Cactus Flower\" are maintained on the bug tracker.

Before being eaten, it must first be placed on top of a solid block. Placing the cake on a slab also works, as the slab acts like a solid block. The cake instead floats half a block on top of the slab.\nEach cake has seven \"slices\"; each use consumes one slice progressing inward from the west. A single slice restores 2 () hunger and 0.4 hunger saturation. Eating all seven slices of a cake restores 14 ( × 7) hunger and 2.8 hunger saturation.\nSince eating a cake comes with no animation, the cake can be eaten at a rate of one slice per tick. Multiple players can eat from the same cake at the same time. In Java Edition, eating cake makes no sound, unlike other foods.\nAs a redstone component, when connected to a comparator, a whole cake emits a signal strength of 14. The signal strength decreases two units with each slice.\nCake destroys falling blocks if placed under them, similar to a torch. A player who is sneaking can place any block (including a cake or a falling block) on top of a cake without the block breaking.\nPandas[edit | edit source]\nSome pandas move toward a dropped cake to pick up and eat it. Some may not, depending on the cake's location.\nComposting[edit | edit source]\nPlacing a cake into a composter raises the compost level by 1.\nPiston interactivity[edit | edit source]\nA cake is broken when pushed by a piston, and it drops nothing.\nCakes with candles[edit | edit source]\nA cake with candle created by placing a candle on an uneaten cake.\nUsing a candle on an uneaten cake creates a candle cake of that color (including uncolored). Eating any of the cake causes the candle to drop.\nUsing flint and steel, fire charge, or any flaming projectile on an unlit candle cake lights its candle. Lit candle cakes emit a light level of 3.

Further details may exist on the talk page.\nThere is an associated technical blocks page for the internal item form of this block; see Technical blocks/Cake.\n[hide]\nJava Edition Beta\nNovember 23, 2010 Notch stated if Minecraft won the 2010 Indie of the Year Awards, he would add cake to Minecraft.\n1.2\nSince Minecraft won the title, cake has been added.\nCake heals 18HP × 9.\nCake with six bites taken out of it exists, but is normally inaccessible until release version 1.8, as using a cake with five bites will consume it completely.\n1.5 Achievements have been added, including \"The Lie\", which is rewarded when the player crafts a cake.\n1.7 The textures for the side and inside of cakes have been shifted vertically due to changes to texture mapping in this version. This does not change how normally-obtainable states of cake look (see #Data history for a case where this change has a visual impact]]), but texture packs from previous versions will no longer be compatible.\n1.8 Pre-release Cake now restores 12 ( × 6).\nCake is available in the Creative inventory.\n[hide]\nJava Edition\n1.2.1 ? When cake is crafted, the empty buckets are now moved to the player's inventory, rather than staying in the crafting grid.\n1.5 13w02a Cakes now use the inside texture for all orthogonal faces.\n13w03a Cakes now use the outside side texture for the sides again.[1]\n1.8 14w02a Farmer villagers now sell 1 cake for 1 emerald.\n14w28a Cake slices available when eating cakes have been increased from 6 to 7, allowing the 6-bites cake to be obtained legitimately.\nCake now emits a comparator signal.\nWhen cake is crafted, empty buckets now stay in the crafting table.\n1.9 15w37a Cake can no longer be eaten in survival with the primary attack (left-click).\n1.14 18w43a\nThe texture of cake has been changed.\nCakes can now be eaten by pandas when they are thrown to them.\n19w03a Placing a cake into the new composter now raises the compost level by 1.\n19w08a The texture of cake items have been changed, this time to have a large cherry in the middle to match its block counterpart.\nMay 17–20, 2019 Cakes now display a \"10\" above them, textured with white concrete, to celebrate the 10 year anniversary of the first public version of Minecraft (0.0.11a) being released.\n1.17 20w45a Added candle cakes.\n21w19a The name of \"Candle Cake\" has been changed to \"Cake with Candle\".\nPre-release 3 Changed lit cake with candle textures.\n[hide]\nUpcoming Java Edition\n1.21.5 25w06a Cake can now be crafted using blue eggs or brown eggs.\n[hide]\nPocket Edition Alpha\nv0.7.0\nAdded cake.\nCake restores 12HP × 6.\nv0.12.1 build 1 Cake now restore 12 ( × 6).\nv0.14.0 build 1 Cake can now be used to emit a comparator signal.\nv0.15.0 ?

These have a glitched appearance, with misaligned cake textures as well as the block placeholder texture on the bottom (as the texture next to the bottom of the cake on terrain.png, which it overflows to, is itself a placeholder).\n1.7\nThe cake side texture shown from underneath has flipped to the other side.\n1.8 Pre-release\nCakes with data 8 through 15 now use the red mushroom block texture with the addition of the red mushroom block.\n[hide]\nJava Edition\n1.5 13w02a\n\nWith the advent of major changes in texture storage and architecture, overeaten cakes now display other parts of cakes as well as part of a crop texture.\nFrom this version up until 14w08a, overeaten cakes start to draw from the textures next to them on blocks-atlas, in much the same way they previously did with terrain.png. However, as texture atlases are unstable and textures tend to change positions as new blocks and textures are added, overeaten cakes change the texture they draw from almost every time new textures are added or existing textures are resized.\n13w03a\n\nOvereaten cakes now display a different part of the cake texture than before.\n13w09a\n\nOvereaten cakes now display a crop texture on the side.\n1.6.1 13w17a\n\nOvereaten cakes now display a part of the powered redstone comparator texture.\n13w18a\n\nOvereaten cakes now display the carrots texture. The inside underside also uses the feet of the cauldron.\n1.7.2 13w41a\n\nOvereaten cakes now display a part of the block breaking texture, and the texture of the block of diamond inside.\n1.8 14w10a Cakes with data values 7 and above now have no model.\n1.13 17w47a Prior to The Flattening, this block's numeral ID was 92, and the item's 354.\nIssues[edit | edit source]\nIssues relating to \"Cake\" are maintained on the bug tracker. Issues should be reported and viewed there.\nTrivia[edit | edit source]\nInteraction[edit | edit source]\nBecause cake is only 7⁄8 blocks wide, it is possible to stand on the edge of a block beneath a cake. This makes it possible to create a functioning staircase using cakes placed on a ramp of 1×1 blocks.\nIt is possible to place cake on top of another cake by placing a cake on the ground, then placing another cake on the side of a block above and to the side of the first cake, similar to placing torches on a chest. Eating the lower cake causes the upper cake to disappear, as does mining out the block of cake it is sitting on.\nMobs on top of cakes rotate while attempting to move, a pathfinding oversight shared with fences.\nIf cake is placed in a hole one block deep, players can get across the hole without jumping, although a player standing on the cake must jump to get out of the hole.\nMiscellaneous[edit | edit source]\nThe 2010 Indie of the Year Awards logo.\nCake was added to Minecraft following the ModDB 2010 Indie of the Year Awards. Notch agreed to add cake to Minecraft if it won, which led to a campaign called \"The Quest For Cake\". Minecraft won 3 of the 7 awards, including the \"Indie of the Year\" award.\nPlacing a cake makes the same sound as placing wool.\nThe player can place cake on top of a bed, and while sleeping, the cake shows on the player's screen as if it were on top of their head.\nThe name of the achievement for crafting a cake is a reference to the internet meme \"The Cake is a Lie\", which originated from Valve Software's game, Portal.\nOn May 17, 2019, for the 10th anniversary of Minecraft, the cake model was changed to display a \"10\" above it, made of white concrete.\nUnlike most foods, cakes don't count towards the advancement \"A Balanced Diet\" in Java Edition.[2]\nGallery[edit | edit source]\nRenders[edit | edit source]\nCake[edit | edit source]\nCake with candle[edit | edit source]\nLit cake with candle[edit | edit source]\nScreenshots[edit | edit source]\nA cake placed on top of another.\nThe sizes of cake when eaten.\nThe 10-years cake model placed in the world.\nMojang screenshots[edit | edit source]\nCake and the Totem of Undying.\nNoor in a room full of cake.\nIn other media[edit | edit source]\nOfficial artwork of Efe with a cake, Sunny bringing a candle, and Ari carrying flint and steel to light it.\nSticker of a cake featured in 15 Year Journey.\nA real cake made for a video featuring Jason Momoa and Jack Black, promoting both A Minecraft Movie and the 15th anniversary.\nEfe crafting cakes with a crafter.\nDeveloper concept for stacked cakes.\nA Halloween candy bowl with an assortment of sweets and obsidian.\nCake figure of Flippin' Figs\nReferences[edit | edit source]\n↑ MC-7119 — Cake uses inside texture on all sides when placed — resolved as \"Fixed\".\n↑ MC-117561 — Cake not counting in 'A Balanced Diet' advancement\nNavigation[edit | edit source]\n[hide]\nv t e\nBlocks\n[show]\nStructural\n[show]\nOrnamental\n[show]\nNatural\n[hide]\nUtility\nInteractable Anvil Chipped Damaged Barrel Beacon Brewing Stand Cartography Table Chest Ender Crafting Table Enchanting Table Furnace Blast Smoker Grindstone Lectern Loom Shulker Box Dyed Sign Hanging Smithing Table Stonecutter\nUtilizable Banners Ominous Beehive Beds Bell Cake with Candle Campfire Soul Cauldron Lava Powder Snow Water Chiseled Bookshelf Composter Conduit Decorated Pot End Gateway End Portal End Portal Frame Farmland Fletching Table Flower Pot Frosted Ice Heads Skeleton Wither Skeleton Zombie Creeper Piglin Dragon Heavy Core Jukebox Ladder Lodestone Monster Spawner Nether Portal Respawn Anchor Scaffolding Sponge Wet Suspicious Gravel Suspicious Sand TNT Trial Spawner Ominous Vault Ominous\nRedstone/Mechanical Buttons Wooden Stone Polished Blackstone Copper Bulb Crafter Daylight Detector Dispenser Dropper Doors Copper Iron Wooden Honey Block Hopper Lever Lightning Rod Note Block Observer Piston Sticky Head Moving Pressure Plates Wooden Stone Polished Blackstone Heavy Weighted Light Weighted Rail Activator Detector Powered Redstone Lamp Redstone Wire Comparator Repeater Torch Slime Block Target Trapped Chest Trapdoors Copper Iron Wooden Fence Gates Tripwire Hook Tripwire\nMinecraft Education only Chalkboard\nBE & edu only Allow Border Compound Creator Deny Element Constructor Heat Block Item Frame Glow Lab Table Material Reducer Underwater TNT Underwater Torch\n[show]\nCreative or commands only\n[show]\nUnused\n[show]\nUnimplemented\n[show]\nJoke features\n[show]\nRemoved",

Like its counterpart, it detects vibrations, but it has twice the range and can detect multiple vibrations in quicker succession. It outputs a signal on all sides except for its input, which can receive power to make the sensor listen only to specific vibrations, depending on the input signal strength.\nContents\n1 Obtaining\n1.1 Breaking\n1.2 Crafting\n2 Usage\n2.1 Filtering\n3 Sounds\n3.1 Generic\n3.2 Unique\n4 Data values\n4.1 ID\n4.2 Block states\n4.3 Block data\n5 Video\n6 History\n6.1 Data history\n7 Issues\n8 Gallery\n9 References\n10 Navigation\nObtaining[edit | edit source]\nBreaking[edit | edit source]\nA calibrated sculk sensor can be mined with any tool, but hoes are the quickest.

For more information, see Breaking § Speed.\nCrafting[edit | edit source]\nIngredients Crafting recipe\nAmethyst Shard +\nSculk Sensor\n\nUsage[edit | edit source]\nWhen a calibrated sculk sensor detects a vibration, it is activated and emits redstone signal in every direction (including top and bottom), except the side with the amethyst stripe. The redstone signal emitted from the bottom will strongly power the block below the sensor, where as in all other directions (excluding the side with the amethyst stripe), it is as though the sensor itself is the strongly powered block.\nAn activated Calibrated Sculk Sensor. Only the block below the sensor is strongly powered. All other sides react as though the sensor itself were strongly powered, excluding the side with the amethyst stripe.\n\nThe calibrated sculk sensor is different from the basic sculk sensor in multiple ways:\ncan detect vibrations within a distance of 16 blocks, instead of 8.\nis activated for 10 game ticks after detecting a vibration instead of 30 game ticks\ncan be filtered (see below) to react only to some sounds.\none side does not emit a redstone signal when activated (the side with the amethyst stripe).\nWhen a calibrated sculk sensor detects a vibration, it is activated for 10 game ticks, then has a 10 game tick cooldown before it can detect another vibration. This means that a calibrated sculk sensor can detect a vibration once per second, as opposed to once every two seconds for a regular sculk sensor.\nFiltering[edit | edit source]\nWhen a redstone signal powers a calibrated sculk sensor on its crystalized side, the sensor is filtered to respond only to vibrations that match the strength of that signal. Every vibration in the game has a frequency associated with it, and every vibration frequency directly matches a specific redstone signal strength. For example, a vibration with a frequency of 5 matches the redstone signal with a strength of 5.\nSome events can create multiple vibrations simultaneously. For example, eating most food items creates vibrations of frequency 3 (item interaction) and 8 (entity eats). Hitting the ground and taking fall damage creates vibrations of frequency 2 (hit ground) and 7 (entity damage). Using a redstone signal, the sensor can be filtered to detect either frequency. If no redstone signal is provided, the sensor detects the highest frequency.\nSculk sensor vibration frequencies\nRedstone Sounds with that frequency\nSignal Wire\n1 Walking (not sneaking), climbing, jumping, swimming, crawling on a non-wool block.\n2 Landing on any solid block (i.e. stone, a slime block, or a honey block) or in any liquid (water, lava, or powder snow).\n3 Using an item (casting a fishing pole, throwing a snowball, drinking a potion, drinking milk, etc.).\n4 A player gliding with an elytra or a mob performing a unique action (e.g. a ravager roaring, a wolf shaking, etc.).\n5 Dismounting a mob or equipping a piece of gear.\n6 Mounting a mob or interacting with a mob (e.g. trading with a villager, etc).\n7 A mob or player taking damage.\n8 Eating a food item.\n9 A block 'deactivating' (e.g. closing a door or chest, a pressed button becoming unpressed, etc.).\n10 A block 'activating' (e.g. opening a door or chest, a button being pressed, etc.).\n11 A block changing (e.g. adding food to campfire, etc.).\n12 A non-wool block getting destroyed.\n13 A non-wool block getting placed.\n14 A mob or player teleporting or spawning.\n15 A mob or player dying, or an explosion happening.\nSounds[edit | edit source]\nA calibrated sculk sensor is silent if waterlogged.

It may also be placed, creating a camera entity that can track the user, and take pictures from the camera's perspective. Photos that are taken with the camera appear in the portfolio.\nClose-up snapshots of an item on the ground can be taken by holding the Shift key while right-clicking.\nScreenshots from camera can be inserted into book and quill.[1]\nPhotos that are taken with the camera block are stored in com.mojang/screenshots.\nBehavior[edit | edit source]\nCamera in a boat\nCameras are mostly inanimate entities, but they occasionally move when falling and they move at the player's direction when they take a picture.\nCameras are classified as mobs in the game code, they obey gravity, allowing them to fall and having effects common to all other entities. Cameras can be affected by status effects. They can be killed by Harming and Decay splash/lingering potions, and they play the player death sound and fall to their side and disappear, dropping no item. Cameras can't be leashed but they can ride on boats and minecarts.\nCamera being harmed by poison effect\nCameras are harmed by fire, lava, and campfire damage but they never die from it. Cameras can be destroyed by any projectile used by the player, such as arrows, tridents, or snowballs. Cameras never drown and are invulnerable to the void, cacti, falling blocks, to explosions or by firework rockets.\nWardens, withers, zoglins, goats, and vindicators named Johnny attack cameras, but the camera remains undamaged; pufferfish also inflate when an camera is nearby.

A regular campfire drops 2 charcoal.

Unlike regular fire, a campfire's fire does not spread under any circumstances.\nCampfires are lit by default when placed. A campfire can be manually lit by using flint and steel on it (either by player or by dispenser), using a fire charge on it, shooting it with a flaming arrow, or using or dispensing fire charges, blaze fireballs, and ghast fireballs when /gamerule mobGriefing is true. In Bedrock Edition, campfires can also be lit by using an item enchanted with Fire Aspect, or stepping on it while burning.\nA campfire can be extinguished by waterlogging it (placing water in the same block space), throwing a splash water bottle on it, or using a shovel on it. Campfires cannot be extinguished from their bottom face.‌[JE only][1] In Bedrock Edition, campfires can also be extinguished by placing a water source or allowing water to flow in the space above the campfire. As with torches, rain does not extinguish campfires.[2]\nUsing flint and steel on the side of a waterlogged or lit campfire sets the adjacent air block on fire instead.\nParticles and smoke signals[edit | edit source]\nA campfire emitting smoke\nCampfires produce smoke particles that float up around 10 blocks before disappearing. If a hay bale is placed below, the campfire becomes a signal fire and the smoke floats up 24 blocks instead.\nCampfire smoke particles can partially pass through a block directly above it, but do not pass through blocks any higher than that.\nAlthough a trapdoor is thinner than a slab, a trapdoor can block the smoke completely, preventing the smoke from floating up.\nCampfires emit extra smoke particles during rain, similar to lava.\nCampfires also occasionally emit ember particles, similar to lava.\nDamage[edit | edit source]\nIf lit, campfires damage mobs standing on top of them, even if underwater (with exceptions such as shulkers, zombified piglins, or guardians). Campfires deal 1HP every tick (although damage immunity reduces this to once every half-second). Campfires do not cause lasting burning or destroy items. Damage taken is not considered fire damage, so armor itself does not reduce damage caused by campfire; to do so, the player need the Resistance potion effects, or the Protection and Fire Protection enchantments. The player can avoid being damaged at all, either by using a potion of Fire Resistance or wearing Frost Walker boots.\nRegardless of height, all blocks prevent damage done to mobs or players above campfires. The campfire deals damage only to entities occupying its block.\nCooking[edit | edit source]\nSome food being cooked on a campfire\nThe player can place any of the following food items on a lit campfire by using the food item on it.\nRaw Beef\nRaw Chicken\nRaw Rabbit\nRaw Porkchop\nRaw Mutton\nRaw Cod\nRaw Salmon\nPotato\nKelp\nUp to four food items can be placed on a campfire, which cooks the items simultaneously. Unlike other blocks that can cook food, campfires do not require any kind of fuel to cook. On a campfire, foods produce small smoke particles, indicating they are being cooked. Food items take 30 seconds (600 ticks) to cook, compared to 10 seconds for furnaces or 5 seconds for smokers. Assuming that one uses all four slots to cook at once, campfires are more efficient than furnaces (taking 10 seconds less per four items and no fuel) for cooking, but must be watched so as to pick up the food and refill it once it is done. It is slower than a smoker by about ten seconds, but its lack of fuel consumption could be seen as a worthwhile trade-off. Once finished cooking, items pop off the campfire. If the campfire is extinguished while cooking food, the remaining cooking time quickly counts back up. Food items can be placed on an unlit campfire. Any items cooking on a campfire always drop when the campfire block is broken.\nOther items can be placed on campfires using external editors, mods, or add-ons.\nHoppers[edit | edit source]\nCampfires do not have an external inventory. Raw food cannot be loaded into the campfire with a hopper.\nA hopper placed directly underneath a campfire pulls through any items dropped into the campfire. Any drops from a mob that dies in the campfire get pulled into the hopper.\nBees[edit | edit source]\nPlacing a campfire under a beehive or bee nest allows honey bottles and honeycomb to be harvested without provoking the bees.\nThere must be unobstructed air between the campfire and the beehive or bee nest. Carpets are an exception.‌[Java Edition only]\nLight source[edit | edit source]\nStandard lit campfires emit a light level of 15. Like most other sources of light, campfires melt nearby snow and ice.\nNote blocks[edit | edit source]\nCampfires can be placed under note blocks to produce \"bass\" sounds.\nPiston interactivity[edit | edit source]\nIn Bedrock Edition, pushing a campfire with a piston or sticky piston breaks it. Campfires cannot be pulled by sticky pistons.\nIn Java Edition, pistons do not interact with campfires. Campfires neither move nor break when pushed or pulled by pistons.\nSounds[edit | edit source]\nGeneric[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition:\n[hide]\nv t e\nwood sound type\nSound Subtitles Source

A single candle emits a light level of 3. Up to four identically colored candles may be placed in one block, with each candle increasing the emitted light level by 3, for a maximum light level of 12. They also emit fire particles.\nCandles Light level\n1 3\n2 6\n3 9\n4 12\nCandles are not lit when they are placed, and must be lit using flint and steel, fire charge, or any flaming projectile. If any candle is already lit, more candle(s) that may be added (if possible) are also lit. In Bedrock Edition, a mob/player that is burning, a Fire Aspect book or any sword enchanted with Fire Aspect can also be used to light candles. Any candle may be waterlogged, but waterlogged candles cannot be lit. Lit candles can be extinguished using water (even a water bottle‌[Java Edition only]), wind charges, or by the player interacting with the candle.\nCakes[edit | edit source]\nA single candle of any color may be used on an uneaten cake, turning it into a candle cake, which acts as a normal, singular candle on top of a cake. If the candle cake is eaten at all or destroyed, the candle is dropped. Interacting with the lit candle (but not the cake) extinguishes it. Interacting with a lit candle cake causes the player to eat it if possible, but if the held item is a flint and steel or fire charge, the appropriate block becomes lit, if possible (otherwise nothing happens).\nSounds[edit | edit source]\nGeneric[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition:\n[hide]\nv t e\ncandle sound type\nSound Subtitles Source Description Resource location Translation key Volume Pitch

It has a hitbox of 1⁄16 of a block and covers the entire surface of the block it is placed on. This thickness prevents mob spawning.\nCarpet can be placed on any block, including non-solid blocks, except air and item frame‌[Java Edition only]. When placed on grass or fern, they break and the carpet is placed on the block below. When placed on vines, the topmost block of vines breaks and the carpet is placed on the block below, any vines blocks below the first one don't break. It can even be placed over water blocks, but to do so you must target an adjacent block with a visible hitbox.\nCarpet can be pushed and pulled by pistons but pops off if pushed onto a hole or pulled downward. It can also break falling sand and gravel.\nCarpet is an opaque block but does not decrease light going through it. Because of this and the fact that it can be placed on any block, a common decorative strategy is to place carpet on a light-emitting block in the floor, illuminating a room and hiding the light source at the same time.\nCarpets can be placed on top of fences and walls to allow the player to jump on top of them while still preventing animals and mobs from crossing. This is because mobs do not try jump over fences and walls, even with a carpet above.\nIn Java Edition, if a campfire is placed beneath a beehive to pacify bees, the campfire can be placed below ground and a carpet placed over the campfire to protect bees from the fire. In Bedrock Edition, a carpet over a campfire removes the campfire's pacifying effect on bees.\nIf a carpet is placed so that it lays on top of a hopper, the hopper can still collect items through the carpet. This is because hoppers can collect items from less than a full block above in Java Edition, or less than 3⁄4 of a block above in Bedrock Edition.\nCarpets can also be placed over other carpets. Mobs are unable to walk over two or more layers of carpets, because the mob's AI treats carpets as if they are air blocks. If a mob stands on a double carpet layer, it stays perfectly still.‌[Java Edition only] Similarly, endermen are unable to teleport onto double carpet layers.\nCarpets, similar to wool, dampens vibrations from sculk sensors. These include placing, breaking, and entities walking/jumping on. However, unlike wool, carpets dampen only horizontal vibration paths.\nDecorating llamas[edit | edit source]\nAll llama carpet patterns.\nLlamas can be equipped with carpets in their carpet slot (). Each carpet color shows as a different patterned rug on the llama's back.\nEnchanting[edit | edit source]\nCarpets cannot be enchanted in survival mode. However, in Java Edition creative mode, just like any other item, it can be enchanted with any enchantment using an anvil. While most enchantments have no effect, Thorns, Protection, Fire Protection, Blast Protection, Curse of Binding and Curse of Vanishing apply their effects to the llama as expected.\nFuel[edit | edit source]\nCarpet can be used as a fuel in furnaces, smelting 0.335 items per carpet item.‌[Java Edition only]\nBreaking tall grass and vines[edit | edit source]\nWhen placed on the top half of blocks like tall grass, large fern, or vines they break and the carpet drops as an item.\nSounds[edit | edit source]\nGeneric[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition:\n[hide]\nv t e\nwool sound type\nSound

Eating a carrot restores 3 () hunger and 3.6 hunger saturation.\nFarming[edit | edit source]\nSee also: Crop farming\nCarrots can be farmed and harvested on farmland. Planted carrots go through 8 stages of growth, but only 4 apparent stages because the texture only changes upon reaching stages 1, 3, 5, and 8 with stage 8 being the final, mature appearance.\nCarrots require a light level of 8 or greater to plant‌[Java Edition only] and 9 or greater to grow. In Bedrock Edition they can be planted at any light level, but need an internal light level of 9 to grow. Crops grow faster if the farmland they are planted in is hydrated. Using bone meal on crops also increases the speed of growth by randomly increasing their growth stage by 2 to 5.\nCrops break if pushed by a piston or if their supporting farmland breaks or turns to dirt (e.g. by being trampled), dropping their usual drops.\nIf /gamerule mobGriefing is true, rabbits find mature carrot crops‌[Java Edition only] / carrot crops with growth stage greater than 1‌[Bedrock Edition only]. This reduces the growth stages by one, removing the crop completely when the growth stage reaches 0.\nBreeding[edit | edit source]\nCarrots can also be used to breed and attract pigs and rabbits.\nVillagers can pick up carrot items to become willing, which allow them to breed.

They can also be used for adding pointers to maps, creating empty maps, and renaming maps.‌[Bedrock Edition only]\nBelow is a list of brief descriptions of all available functions of the cartography table:\nFor more detailed information of each of these functions, see Map § Usage.\nFirst slot Second slot Result\nMap Paper Zoomed out map (1 zoom level higher)\nMap Empty map Two identical maps\nMap Glass Pane Locked map\nMap Compass Locator map‌[Bedrock Edition only]\nEmpty map Compass Empty Locator map‌[Bedrock Edition only]\nPaper Empty map‌[Bedrock Edition only]\nPaper Compass Empty Locator map‌[Bedrock Edition only]\nZooming out a map always starts with an existing map, not a blank map. Zooming it out makes the map aligned to the grid that would include the area of the original map. To build a set of maps such as for a map wall, a player cannot create several level 0 (base) maps at one location then zoom them out before going out into the world to fill them in; the player must start with a base map created in each area to be covered by the zoomed out map. See more discussion of map alignment at Map.\nProfession[edit | edit source]\nMain article: Job site block\nIf a cartography table has not been claimed by a villager, any nearby unemployed villager

It cannot be pulled.\nNatural generation[edit | edit source]\nCarved pumpkins generate in rail rooms in woodland mansions, as well as in pillager outposts as a part of scarecrows.\nMob loot[edit | edit source]\nThe carved pumpkin of a snow golem can be obtained by shearing its head, revealing the golem's face. The carved pumpkin cannot be put back on the golem.\nPost-generation[edit | edit source]\nA carved pumpkin (and 4 pumpkin seeds in Java Edition or 1 unit of pumpkin seeds in Bedrock Edition) is obtained by using shears on an uncarved pumpkin. Once carved, a pumpkin cannot be changed back to uncarved. This changes the rotation of the top texture.‌[Java Edition only][1]\nUsage[edit | edit source]\nWhen placed, a carved pumpkin automatically faces the player. However, in Java Edition the stems are directional, meaning the stem will point towards the face, while in Bedrock Edition the stems are non-directional, meaning the stems always face northwest just like normal pumpkins.\nCrafting ingredient[edit | edit source]\nName Ingredients\n[hide]\nCrafting recipe\nJack o'Lantern Carved Pumpkin +\nTorch\n\nHelmet[edit | edit source]\nA carved pumpkin can be equipped as a helmet without any actual armor value. When worn, it limits the player's viewing area to a mask pattern that resembles the pumpkin's carved face. The pattern does not appear when using the third-person view (toggled by F5 by default). In Java Edition, it also doesn't appear when the heads-up display is disabled by pressing F1.[2]\nA player wearing a carved pumpkin does not aggravate endermen or freeze creakings when looking at them. Wearing a carved pumpkin makes the player invisible to other players on a locator map.\nDispensers[edit | edit source]\nDispensers can equip a carved pumpkin on a player, mob or armor stand with an empty helmet slot, within the block the dispenser is facing.

Notice the incorrect cat skin.\nA single empty cauldron is generated in each swamp hut. In Bedrock Edition, the cauldrons generated there are 1⁄3 to 2⁄3 full of a random potion.\nA cauldron 2⁄3 full of water is generated in each igloo basement.\nCauldron in woodland mansion jail.\nCauldrons can be found in a few rooms inside of woodland mansions.\nTwo filled cauldrons can be found inside savanna, taiga, snowy taiga, and snowy tundra village tannery houses.\nA single filled cauldron can be found in plains village and desert village tannery houses.\nIn Java Edition, three filled cauldrons can be found in plains village tannery houses.\nCauldrons can also generate in trail ruins.\nCrafting[edit | edit source]\nA cauldron can be crafted from iron ingots.\nIngredients\n[hide]\nCrafting recipe\nIron Ingot\n\nUsage[edit | edit source]\nStorage for substances[edit | edit source]\nCauldrons can hold a variety of substances. Fluids they cannot hold include milk, honey and any food items that exist in bowls; namely mushroom stew, beetroot soup, rabbit stew and suspicious stew. In Java Edition, cauldrons containing fluids are considered by the game to be separate blocks from each other and from empty cauldrons, which does not affect gameplay but does affect the commands needed to place them.\nHolding water[edit | edit source]\nA cauldron can be filled with water by using a water bucket on the cauldron. Once completely filled, a cauldron can be used to fill a water bucket by using an empty bucket on the cauldron; this empties the cauldron. Despite containing water, using a fish bucket on a cauldron does not fill it with water, but places water against it, meaning it does nothing to the cauldron.[1]\nA cauldron can also be filled by dumping a water bucket on the block above the cauldron. Once the water block is removed, the cauldron is filled to the full level with water.‌[Bedrock Edition only]\nIn Java Edition, a cauldron can contain three levels of water. One level of water can be added to a cauldron by using a water bottle on it. One level of water can be removed from a cauldron, filling a water bottle, by using a glass bottle on it.\nIn Bedrock Edition, a cauldron can contain six levels of water, and using a water bottle or a bottle on a cauldron respectively adds or removes two levels from it. If there are less than two levels remaining, a bottle cannot be used to retrieve the remaining water, and it must be either replaced or removed through a method that reduces the level by one.\nA cauldron slowly fills with water when rained upon, if starting empty or with some water. This happens randomly, at 5% of the rate in which snow accumulates on the ground during snowfall.\nWater can be stored in a cauldron, even in the Nether. Water in a cauldron does not freeze in cold biomes.\nWater in a cauldron does not absorb explosion damage; make sounds and particles; absorb fall damage;[2][3] allow tridents enchanted with Riptide to activate;[4][5] or damage endermen‌[JE only], striders, or blazes.[6][7] Cauldrons do not deal drowning damage to mobs inside of them[8] and fish act as if there is no water inside it.[9] The player cannot float or swim in it, as the water is about level with the player's waist. Jumping in a cauldron does not produce any bubble or water particles.\nA cauldron placed below a down-facing pointed dripstone that has water placed a block above it slowly fills with water. The same works with lava, allowing for infinite lava generation. The pointed dripstone must be within 10 blocks above the cauldron.\nAttempting to add lava or potion to water empties the cauldron.‌[Bedrock Edition only]\nThe water in a cauldron cannot be sucked up by a sponge, whether the sponge is touching the cauldron or not.[10]\nApplying dye to cauldron water[edit | edit source]\nThis feature is exclusive to Bedrock Edition. \nIn Bedrock Edition, a cauldron can hold dyed water. Using a dye on a cauldron filled with water colors the water, consuming the dye. Different dyes may be added to produce mixed colors. Using any piece of leather armor, leather horse armor, or wolf armor on the cauldron dyes that item the color of the water, reducing the water in the cauldron by one level for each item dyed.\nAttempting to add water, lava, powder snow, or potions to dyed water empties the cauldron.\nHolding lava[edit | edit source]\nCauldron filled with lava\nCauldrons can be used to hold lava. In Bedrock Edition and Minecraft Education, when a cauldron is already filled with water, it empties the cauldron and makes an extinguishing sound. A cauldron filled with lava emits a light level of 15, similar to lava, and burns any entity inside of it; in Bedrock Edition and Minecraft Education, this includes mobs that do not take damage from lava like zombified piglins.\nLava inside a cauldron does not interact with water outside of the cauldron. The lava disappears upon putting water in the cauldron.\nA redstone comparator with a lava cauldron behind it outputs redstone signal strength of 3.[11][12]\nA cauldron placed below a down-facing pointed dripstone that has lava placed a block above it slowly fills with lava.\nIf a cauldron is filled by lava, using glass bottles on the cauldron does nothing.\nHolding powder snow[edit | edit source]\nPowder snow is currently the only solid material that can be stored in a cauldron. A cauldron slowly fills with powder snow during snowfall, if starting empty or with any layer of powder snow already inside. Up to three‌[JE only] or six‌[BE only] layers can be filled. When the cauldron is full, interacting using a bucket, creates a powder snow bucket and empties the cauldron. Entities standing in the cauldron do not take freeze damage, and entities wearing leather boots still fall through the powder snow.\nA redstone comparator with a powder snow cauldron behind it outputs a redstone signal strength proportional to the fill level, up to 3.\nContrary to a cauldron filled with water, a powder snow cauldron that is not full cannot be filled up with a powder snow bucket, as using the bucket on the cauldron instead places powder snow against it.\nHolding potions[edit | edit source]\nThis feature is exclusive to Bedrock Edition and Minecraft Education. \nIn Bedrock Edition, a cauldron can hold normal potions, splash potions and lingering potions. Using a potion on a cauldron empties the potion and increases the level of the potion in the cauldron by two levels. A glass bottle can then be used on a cauldron with a potion in it, filling the bottle with that potion. This reduces the potion in the cauldron by two levels. If there is only one level of potion remaining, it cannot be retrieved using a bottle and must be either replaced or used to tip an arrow.\nUsing an arrow on a cauldron that contains a potion transforms the arrow into a tipped arrow with that potion effect, and reduces the potion in the cauldron by one level. Tipping multiple arrows at once can be more efficient, and it may use more than one level at once. 1 level of potion tips up to 16 arrows, 2 levels up to 32, 3 levels up to 48, and 4 levels up to a full stack of arrows, resulting in 21.33 tipped arrows per potion. The bottom three levels of a cauldron are only counted as a single level for the purposes of tipping arrows, therefore any quantity of arrows that would leave less than three levels of potion remaining when tipped empties the cauldron completely.\nAttempting to put water, lava or a different potion into a cauldron with a potion causes an explosion sound, and the cauldron is emptied.\nAn entity that stands in a cauldron filled to any level with any potion does not receive the effect of the potion.\nUsing an empty bucket on a cauldron filled with any potion does nothing, as the bucket remains empty and the potion in the cauldron does not empty.\nRemoving dye from items[edit | edit source]\nA cauldron with water can wash the dye off of leather armor, leather horse armor, wolf armor, and shulker boxes, and can remove the top-most pattern layer of a banner. This is done by pressing use on the cauldron with the leather armor, wolf armor, shulker box, or banner in hand. Each wash reduces the water in the cauldron by one level. The water does not become dyed while removing dye from objects.\nProfession[edit | edit source]\nMain article: Job site block\nIf a cauldron has not been claimed by a villager, any nearby unemployed villager has a chance to change their profession to leatherworker and claim the cauldron as their job site block.\nExtinguishing fire[edit | edit source]\nA cauldron with water or powder snow extinguishes entities on fire that fall into it and the entity emits black particles. This includes mobs, players, items (if they land in the cauldron before burning up), and flaming arrows‌[JE only]. Flaming arrows stuck into the side are also extinguished. Entities must reach the water or powder snow in it. Each entity extinguished causes the substance in the cauldron to decrease by one level. If the cauldron is filled with powder snow, it then becomes a water cauldron.\nRedstone component[edit | edit source]\nAn example of a cauldron used in a redstone circuit.\nSee also: Redstone circuit\nA cauldron can act as a power source for a redstone comparator. With a cauldron behind it (either directly, or separated by an unpowered solid block), a comparator outputs a signal strength proportional to how full the cauldron is: 0 for empty, 1 for one-third full, 2 for two-thirds full, and 3 for completely full or filled with lava. However, if there is a block between the cauldron and the comparator, the comparator does not immediately update.\nSounds[edit | edit source]\nGeneric[edit | edit source]\nDespite being composed entirely of iron, cauldrons do not use iron sounds.[13]\nJava Edition:\n[hide]\nv t e\nstone sound type\nSound Subtitles Source Description Resource location Translation key Volume Pitch

They always generate above magma cube spawners, also found in treasure room bastions.\nChains can also generate in mineshafts. They generate on the sides of a wooden bridge (a mid-air corridor) when the distance between the bridge and the highest solid block below it is higher than the distance to the lowest solid block above it. Chains here generate vertically in a pillar between the bridge and the ceiling. The lowest block of the pillar, connecting the chain to the bridge, is always an oak fence.\nIn addition, chains can also generate in trial chambers making up various hanging platforms in certain rooms.\nGenerated loot[edit | edit source]\nItem Structure Container Quantity\n[hide]\nChance\nJava Edition and Bedrock Edition\nChain Bastion Remnant Generic chest 2–10 24.4%\nCrafting[edit | edit source]\nIngredients\n[hide]\nCrafting recipe\nIron Nugget +\nIron Ingot\n\nUsage[edit | edit source]\nChains can be used to suspend bells, hanging signs, lanterns, and soul lanterns, as the chain texture connects to the chain of the lantern seamlessly as if it were part of it, and it connects the hanging sign chains together. Chains do not require a supporting block to be placed whether it is on the top, next to it or at the bottom. It can exist completely free-standing in mid air[1] and it can be rotated. Chains connect horizontally or vertically, but not across different orientations (so a chain with N orientation does not connect to a chain with E orientation in the adjacent block). Horizontal chains one block above a surface may be walked over. Horizontal chains two blocks above a surface prevent players from traveling past them. Vertical chains block travel if targeted directly, but may be skirted.\nPrecision is required, but chains can be walked on, allowing for inconspicuous, although somewhat costly, bridges.\nChains can be pushed by pistons without being broken.\nIn Bedrock Edition, chains are not conductive, but the comparator can work in being separated from the measured block by a chain.\nCrafting ingredient[edit | edit source]\nName Ingredients\n[hide]\nCrafting recipe\nHanging Sign Chain +\nMatching Stripped Log or\nBlock of Stripped Bamboo or\nMatching Stripped Stem\n\n6\nSounds[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition:\n[hide]\nv t e\nchain sound type\nSound Subtitles Source Description Resource location Translation key Volume Pitch Attenuation\ndistance\nBlock broken Blocks Once the block has broken block.chain.break subtitles.block.generic.break 0.5 0.8 16\nBlock placed Blocks When the block is placed block.chain.place subtitles.block.generic.place 0.5 0.8 16\nBlock breaking Blocks While the block is in the process of being broken block.chain.hit subtitles.block.generic.hit 0.2 0.5 16\nSomething falls on a block Entity-Dependent Falling on the block with fall damage block.chain.fall subtitles.block.generic.fall 0.5 0.75 16\nFootsteps Entity-Dependent Walking on the block block.chain.step subtitles.block.generic.footsteps 0.15 1.0 16\nBedrock Edition:\n[hide]\nv t e\nchain sound type\nSound Source Description Resource location Volume Pitch\nBlocks Once the block has broken dig.chain 1.0 0.8-1.0\nBlocks When the block is placed dig.chain 1.0 0.8-1.0\nBlocks While the block is in the process of being broken hit.chain 1.0 0.8-1.0\nPlayers Falling on the block with fall damage fall.chain 0.4 1.0\nPlayers Walking on the block step.chain 0.3 1.0\nBlocks Jumping from the block jump.chain 0.12 1.0\nBlocks Falling on the block without fall damage land.chain 0.22 1.0\nData values[edit | edit source]\nID[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition:\nName Identifier Form\n[hide]\nTranslation key\nChain chain Block & Item\nblock.minecraft.chain\nBedrock Edition:\nChain Identifier Numeric ID Form Item ID[i 1]\n[hide]\nTranslation key\nBlock chain 541 Block & Ungiveable Item[i 2] item.chain\ntile.chain.name\nItem chain 619 Item —\ntile.chain.name\n↑ ID of block's direct item form, which is used in savegame files and addons.\n↑ Unavailable with /give command\nBlock states[edit | edit source]\nSee also: Block states\nJava Edition:\nName Default value Allowed values\n[hide]\nDescription\naxis y x The chain is oriented east–west.\ny The chain is oriented vertically.\nz The chain is oriented north–south.\nwaterlogged false false\ntrue Whether or not there's water in the same place as this chain.\nBedrock Edition:\nName Metadata Bits Default value Allowed values Values for\nMetadata Bits\n[hide]\nDescription\npillar_axis 0x1\n0x2 y x 1 The chain is oriented east–west.\ny 0 The chain is oriented vertically.\nz 2 The chain is oriented north–south.\n\nHistory[edit | edit source]\nThere is an associated technical blocks page for the internal item form of this block; see Technical blocks/Chain.\n[hide]\nJava Edition\n1.16 20w16a Added chains.\nChains generate in the newly added bastion remnants, and can be found in their chests.\nChains currently use the generic metal block sounds.\n20w17a Unique sounds have been added for chains.\n20w18a Chains can now be waterlogged.\n1.16.2 20w30a The chance of finding chains in bastion remnant chests is decreased from 31.5% to 24.4%.\nPre-release 1 Chains can now be placed in all orientations.\n1.17 21w07a Chains can now generate in mineshafts.\n21w13a The model of chains has been changed so that the backside texture is mirrored.\n1.19.3\nExperiment\nUpdate 1.20 22w42a Chains are now used to craft hanging signs.\n[hide]\nBedrock Edition\n1.16.0 beta 1.16.0.57 Added chains.\nbeta 1.16.0.63 Unique sounds have been added for chains.\n1.16.100 beta 1.16.100.54 Chains can now be placed in all orientations.\n1.19.50\nExperiment\nNext Major Update Preview 1.19.50.21 Chains are now used to craft hanging signs.\n1.20.30 Preview 1.20.20.21 Increased the blast resistance of chains from 3 to 6.\nIssues[edit | edit source]\nIssues relating to \"Chain\" are maintained on the bug tracker.

In Bedrock Edition, chalkboards cannot be obtained by commands or the Creative inventory, and can only be obtained by using glitches or inventory editors.\nUsage[edit | edit source]\nA chalkboard can be used similarly to a sign, to display text. Once placed, select the chalkboard and enter the desired text and click the \"OK\" button. The \"×\" in the upper right corner of the board closes the edit screen.\nPlacement[edit | edit source]\nChalkboards may be placed on the top or side of other blocks (including non-solid blocks like fences, glass, rails, and other chalkboards). To place a chalkboard, use a chalkboard item while pointing at the block the chalkboard should be attached to. To place a chalkboard on a block that can be interacted with by the use control (for example, chests, note blocks, etc.), sneak while placing the chalkboard.\n1×1 slates placed on the top of a block stand on a short post, facing in the direction of the player who placed it, in any of 16 different directions. 2×1 posters and 2×3 boards can be placed in any of 4 different directions. Chalkboards placed on the side of a block simply float there, even if the block doesn't make contact with the chalkboards.\nText[edit | edit source]\nWhen entering text, six lines of text are available for the slates and posters, while fifteen lines of text are available for the 2×3 boards. To switch between lines, the player can press Enter or the up/down arrow keys. The location of text currently selected has a flashing cursor.\nWhile editing, typing and backspacing can occur at any point in the line by moving the cursor using the left and right arrow keys. Once the end of the line has been reached, the word is hyphenated and is continued on the next line.\nAfter the editing window is closed, right-clicking on a chalkboard reopens the editing menu. Copy and paste can be performed, and no more than the basic/shifted keyboard characters may be entered.\nInteraction[edit | edit source]\nChalkboards act as though they have a use action, so sneaking is required to place blocks or use items while the cursor is pointed at them.\nUnlike signs, boards block a piston from moving.\nBoards have no collision box (they are completely non-solid), so items and mobs can move through boards blocks. Other blocks (including other boards) can be placed on any edge of a board.\nWater and lava flow around boards. Lava can create fire in air blocks next to boards as if the boards were flammable, but the boards do not burn.\nSounds[edit | edit source]\n[hide]\nv t e\nstone sound type\nSound Source Description Resource location Volume Pitch\nBlocks Once the block has broken dig.stone 1.0 0.8-1.0\nBlocks When the block is placed dig.stone 1.0 0.8-1.0\nBlocks While the block is in the process of being broken hit.stone 0.37 0.5\nPlayers Falling on the block with fall damage fall.stone 0.4 1.0\nPlayers Walking on the block step.stone 0.3 1.0\nBlocks Jumping from the block jump.stone 0.12 1.0\nBlocks Falling on the block without fall damage land.stone 0.22 1.0\nData values[edit | edit source]\nID[edit | edit source]\nName Identifier Numeric ID Form Item ID[i 1]\n[hide]\nTranslation key\nBlock chalkboard 230 Block & Ungiveable Item[i 2] Identical[i 3]\ntile.chalkboard.oneByOne.name\ntile.chalkboard.twoByOne.name\ntile.chalkboard.threeByTwo.name\nItem board 454 Item —\ntile.chalkboard.oneByOne.name\ntile.chalkboard.twoByOne.name\ntile.chalkboard.threeByTwo.name\n↑ ID of block's direct item form, which is used in savegame files and addons.\n↑ Unavailable with /give command\n↑ The block's direct item form has the same ID as the block.\nMetadata[edit | edit source]\nSee also: Data values\nChalkboards uses the following data values:\nSlate: 1\nBoard: 2\nPoster: 3\nBlock states[edit | edit source]\nSee also: Block states\nNote: Only the block states for the Slate were tested.

Chests always drop themselves when mined. If the chest contains items, the items are also dropped when the chest is broken. If one half of a large chest is destroyed, the corresponding items from the destroyed chest are dropped and the remaining half continues to function as a small chest.\nBlock Chest\nHardness 2.5\nTool\nBreaking time (sec)[A]\nDefault 3.75\nWooden 1.9\nStone 0.95\nIron 0.65\nDiamond 0.5\nNetherite 0.45\nGolden 0.35\nLegend\ndrops nothing\ndrops something other than the block itself\ndrops the block itself\nitalicized can be instant mined\n↑ These durations ignore other influential factors (e.g. Mining Fatigue), and are measured in seconds. For more information, see Breaking § Speed.\nIn Java Edition, a chest produces oak plank particles when breaking, walking or falling on this block;[1] in Bedrock Edition, a chest produces particles of the block itself.\nNatural generation[edit | edit source]\nSee also: Chest loot\nChests generate naturally in all three dimensions. They can generate in monster rooms, strongholds, villages, jungle pyramids, desert pyramids, nether fortresses, end cities, igloo basements, woodland mansions, shipwrecks, ocean ruins, buried treasure, pillager outposts, bastion remnants, ruined portals, ancient cities and trial chambers.\nLarge chests can occasionally generate in monster rooms by one single chest generating next to the other. They can also generate in certain types of bastion remnants.\nBonus chest[edit | edit source]\nMain article: Bonus chest\nThe bonus chest is a chest that appears near the player's spawn if the \"Bonus chest\" option is toggled on the world creation screen. It generates with a semi-random collection of basic items to help the player survive early on and gather necessary resources, including wood, tools, blocks, and food.\nCrafting[edit | edit source]\nIngredients\n[hide]\nCrafting recipe\nAny Planks\n\nUsage[edit | edit source]\nChests can be used as containers and are an ingredient in some crafting recipes.\nA chest placed adjacent to another chest joins to create a large chest. A player can prevent this, and place two small chests side by side, by sneaking while placing the second chest in Java Edition, pushing a chest into place with a piston in Bedrock Edition, or placing the second chest facing a different direction from the first chest. Alternatively, trapped chests do not combine with normal chests.\nIn Bedrock Edition, chests can be moved by pistons. Water and lava flow around chests without affecting them. Lava can create fire in air blocks next to chests as if the chests were flammable, but the chests do not actually catch fire and cannot be burned.\nContainer[edit | edit source]\nIt has been suggested that this page be moved to Inventory#Chest.\nIf this move affects many pages or may potentially be controversial, do not move the page until a consensus is reached. [discuss]\nReason: Most of this GUI information applies to all inventories.\nWhen moving, be sure to use the appropriate tool instead of simply copying and pasting the page's contents, to preserve edit history.\nThe GUI of a chest.\nThe GUI of a large chest.\nA small chest has 27 slots of inventory space, and a large chest has twice that amount, at 54 slots. In the Java Edition interface, the top three rows for a large chest correspond to the left half of the chest when facing it, and the bottom three rows correspond to the right half. In Bedrock Edition, the top three rows correspond to whichever half was placed first and the bottom three to the other half.\nChests open when used. To move items between the chest inventory and the player inventory or hotbar while the chest GUI is open, drag or shift-click the items. In Java Edition, holding Shift and double-clicking while holding an item moves all items of the type clicked on in or out of the chest, to the extent that space is available for them. To exit the chest GUI, use the Esc control.\nA chest cannot be opened if there is a conductive block above it (in Bedrock Edition, bottom slabs prevent chests from being opened). Solid faces do not prevent chests from opening, so the lid of the chest can phase through blocks such as bottom-half slabs, stairs, and non-conductive full cubes such as glass and ice. Cats sitting on chests prevent them from opening. Because chests themselves are non-conductive, two chests can be stacked on top of one another while still allowing the lower chest to be opened. Players can open chests when they are being hurt (effect of Instant Damage, Poison, Wither, on fire, damaged by other players or mobs, etc.).\nBy default, the GUI of a chest is labeled \"Chest\" and the GUI of a large chest is labeled \"Large Chest\". A chest's GUI label can be changed by naming the chest in an anvil before placing it, or, in Java Edition, by using the /data command (for example, to label a chest at (0,64,0) as \"Bonus Chest!\", use /data merge block 0 64 0 {CustomName:'\"Bonus Chest!\"'}). If half of a large chest is renamed, that name is used to label the GUI of the entire large chest, but if the named half is destroyed the other half reverts to the default label. If both halves of a large chest have different names, the GUI uses the name of the northernmost or westernmost half.\nIn Java Edition, a chest can be \"locked\" by setting its [String] Lock tag using the /data command. If a chest's [String] Lock tag is not blank, the chest cannot be opened unless the player is holding an item with the same name as the Lock tag's text. For example, to lock a chest at (0,64,0) so that the chest cannot be opened unless the player is holding an item named \"Chest Key\", use /data merge block 0 64 0 {Lock:\"Chest Key\"}.\nThe capacity of a chest varies greatly, depending on its size, whether the items inside it are stackable, and whether shulker boxes are used. The minimum capacity is obtained when storing only non-stackable items while the maximum capacity can be achieved when storing items that stack to 64. Filled shulker boxes are not stackable, but each can hold 27 stacks of up to 64 items (excluding other shulker boxes), so filling a chest with them increases the maximum by a factor of 27.\nChest size Slots Maximum number of items\nWithout shulker boxes With shulker boxes\nSmall 27 1,728 46,656\nLarge 54 3,456 93,312\nDonkey, mule, or llama pack[edit | edit source]\nA chest can be added to a donkey, a mule, or a llama by pressing use on the animal.\nA chest attached to a donkey or mule has only 15 slots. A chest attached to a llama has anywhere from 3 to 15 slots depending on its \"Strength\" value (see Llama § Data values). The chest cannot be removed except by killing the carrier. The chest can be opened by holding sneak and pressing use, or by riding the carrier and pressing inventory.\nIf shulker boxes are again used, each donkey, mule or strength value 5 llamas with a chest attached to it can carry up to 405 stacks of items (up to 25920 items), and with strength value 5 llamas, each caravan of 10 llamas with inventories full of shulker boxes can carry up to 4050 stacks of items (up to 259200 items).\nPiglins[edit | edit source]\nPiglins become hostile toward players who open or mine chests.\nCrafting ingredient[edit | edit source]\nName Ingredients\n[hide]\nCrafting recipe\nHopper Iron Ingot +\nChest\n\nBoat with Chest Chest +\nMatching Boat\n\n\nMinecart with Chest Chest +\nMinecart\n\n\nShulker Box Shulker Shell +\nChest\n\nTrapped Chest Tripwire Hook +\nChest\n\n\nFuel[edit | edit source]\nChests can be used as fuel in furnaces, smelting 1.5 items per chest.\nNote blocks[edit | edit source]\nChests can be placed under note blocks to produce the \"bass\" sound.\nChristmas chest[edit | edit source]\nThis feature is exclusive to Java Edition. \nOn December 24–26, chests, large chests, and their trapped chest counterparts have their textures changed to \"Christmas chests\" that look like wrapped Christmas presents. Since the game uses the date stored on the player's computer, players can apply the Christmas chest textures at any time by changing the date on their computer to December 24, 25, or 26.\nSounds[edit | edit source]\nGeneric[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition:\n[hide]\nv t e\nwood sound type\nSound Subtitles Source Description Resource location Translation key Volume Pitch Attenuation\ndistance\nBlock broken Blocks Once the block has broken block.wood.break subtitles.block.generic.break 1.0 0.8 16\nBlock placed Blocks When the block is placed block.wood.place subtitles.block.generic.place 1.0 0.8 16\nBlock breaking Blocks While the block is in the process of being broken block.wood.hit subtitles.block.generic.hit 0.25 0.5 16\nSomething falls on a block Entity-Dependent Falling on the block with fall damage block.wood.fall subtitles.block.generic.fall 0.5 0.75 16\nFootsteps Entity-Dependent Walking on the block block.wood.step subtitles.block.generic.footsteps 0.15 1.0 16\nBedrock Edition:\n[hide]\nv t e\nwood sound type\nSound Source Description Resource location Volume Pitch\nBlocks Once the block has broken dig.wood 1.0 0.8-1.0\nBlocks When the block is placed dig.wood 1.0 0.8\nBlocks While the block is in the process of being broken hit.wood 0.23 0.5\nPlayers Falling on the block with fall damage fall.wood 0.4 1.0\nPlayers Walking on the block step.wood 0.3 1.0\nBlocks Jumping from the block jump.wood 0.12 1.0\nBlocks Falling on the block without fall damage land.wood 0.18 1.0\nUnique[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition:\n[hide]\nSounds\nSound Subtitles Source Description Resource location Translation key Volume Pitch Attenuation\ndistance\nChest closes Blocks When a chest closes block.chest.close subtitles.block.chest.close 0.5 0.9-1.0 16\nChest opens Blocks When a chest opens block.chest.open subtitles.block.chest.open 0.5 0.9-1.0 16\nChest locked Blocks When a player attempts to open a chest locked using the [String] Lock tag block.chest.locked subtitles.block.chest.locked 1.0 1.0 16\nBedrock Edition:\n[hide]\nSounds\nSound Source Description Resource location Volume Pitch\nBlocks When a chest closes random.chestclosed 0.5 0.9-1.0\nBlocks When a chest opens random.chestopen 0.5 0.9-1.0\nData values[edit | edit source]\nID[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition:\nName Identifier Form Block tags\n[hide]\nTranslation key\nChest chest Block & Item guarded_by_piglins\nblock.minecraft.chest\nName\n[hide]\nIdentifier\nBlock entity chest\nBedrock Edition:\nName Identifier Numeric ID Form Item ID[i 1]\n[hide]\nTranslation key\nChest chest 54 Block & Giveable Item[i 2] Identical[i 3]\ntile.chest.name\n↑ ID of block's direct item form, which is used in savegame files and addons.\n↑ Available with /give command.\n↑ The block's direct item form has the same ID as the block.\nName\n[hide]\nSavegame ID\nBlock entity Chest\nBlock states[edit | edit source]\nSee also: Block states\nJava Edition:\nName Default value Allowed values\n[hide]\nDescription\nfacing north east\nnorth\nsouth\nwest The direction the chest's latch is on.\nThe opposite from the direction the player faces when placing a chest.\ntype single left\nright\nsingle The direction the chest has a connection with.\nwaterlogged false false\ntrue Whether or not there's water in the same place as this chest.\nBedrock Edition:\nName Metadata Bits Default value Allowed values Values for\nMetadata Bits\n[hide]\nDescription\nminecraft:cardinal_direction Not Supported north east\nnorth\nsouth\nwest Unsupported The direction the chest's latch is on.\nThe opposite from the direction the player faces when placing a chest.\n\nBlock data[edit | edit source]\nA chest has a block entity associated with it that holds additional data about the block.\nJava Edition:\nSee also: Block entity format\n[NBT Compound / JSON Object] Block entity data\nTags common to all block entities[show]\nTags common to all objects that can be renamed[show]\n[NBT List / JSON Array] Items: List of items in this container.\n[NBT Compound / JSON Object]: An item, including the slot tag.

However, this is purely visual; they still act like two separate chests. Additionally, if the player attempts to open a chest connected on all four sides, the game freezes and the client crashes.\n20100130 Chests can now be crafted.\n[hide]\nJava Edition Infdev\n20100625-1917 Chests now generate in the newly added monster rooms.\n[hide]\nJava Edition Alpha\nv1.0.14 Chests are now used to craft chest minecarts.\n[hide]\nJava Edition Beta\n1.1_02 The placement of chests has been partially fixed. It is still possible to create triple chests, if the chest was not placed horizontally adjacent to a large chest or if placed in the location of a fluid.\nThe game no longer freezes, but instead displays a graphically glitched, fully functional chest screen.\n1.5 Chests can no longer be placed to create a triple chest; however, any chest previously created in this way still functions in that manner.\nShift + clicking on an item or a stack while the chest is opened moves it between the chest and the inventory.\n1.8 Pre-release The chest's model has been redone. Rather than a usual cube, it uses an entity model, which allows for an opening and closing animation, and is also smaller.\nThis conversion to an entity model resulted in anomalies with the chest's item form. When held (in both first person and in third person/by other players) , it is shown at a different angle from other blocks, and when dropped on the ground , it rotates around one of its corners rather than its center, with its shadow also centered on this corner.\nChests now use textures in the \"item\" folder; \"chest.png\" is used for single chests and \"chestlarge.png\" is used for large chests.\nThe particles for chests (when sprinted on, broken, or later when walked on by an iron golem) still use the texture in terrain.png that was used for the sides[verify] of chests before this version.\nChests now change the direction they face based on the viewpoint of the player that places them, rather than adjusting by themselves based on adjacent blocks.\nChests no longer show the block breaking animation.\nChests can now be found in mineshafts, as well as the libraries and storerooms of strongholds.\n[hide]\nJava Edition\n1.0.0 Beta 1.9 Prerelease The opening and closing sound effects of the chest have been removed (it used the same sounds as the door).\nBeta 1.9 Prerelease 3 Chests now generate in the corridor altars of strongholds.\nBeta 1.9 Prerelease 6 Chests do not prevent other chests underneath from opening.\nRC1 The opening and closing sounds of chests have been changed.\n1.1 12w01a Chests can now be found in blacksmiths in villages.\n1.2.4 release Cats now try to sit on chests, making them unopenable.\nSpruce planks, birch planks, and jungle planks can now be used to craft chests.\n1.3.1 12w16a The 'bonus chest' option has now added to the Options menu.\n12w21a The textures which the chest used prior to their model update in Beta 1.8 have been removed from terrain.png, being replaced with the placeholder block texture .\nThe old chest top texture was still used for the block particles up until this version, even after the model change. As the texture has been removed in this version, the oak planks texture is now used for the chest's particles.[2]\nChests can now be found in desert pyramids.\n12w22a The chest item is now aligned more like other item forms of blocks, resulting in a more natural first-person holding position as well as the item form appearing properly aligned in third person as well as when dropped.\nChests can now be found in jungle pyramids.\n12w24a Large chest inventory titles have changed from \"Large chest\" to \"Large Chest\".\n1.4.4 1.4.3 Chests now have a smaller hitbox.

The block itself drops only when broken using a tool enchanted with Silk Touch.[1]\nBlock Chiseled Bookshelf\nHardness 1.5\nTool\nBreaking time (sec)[A]\nDefault 2.25\nWooden 1.15\nStone 0.6\nIron 0.4\nDiamond 0.3\nNetherite 0.25\nGolden 0.2\nOptions\nEfficiency\n0\nHaste\n0\nJE\nBE\nLegend\ndrops nothing\ndrops something other than the block itself\ndrops the block itself\nitalicized can be instant mined\n↑ These durations ignore other influential factors (e.g. Mining Fatigue), and are measured in seconds. For more information, see Breaking § Speed.\nCrafting[edit | edit source]\nIngredients\n[hide]\nCrafting recipe\nAny Planks +\nAny Wooden Slab\n\nUsage[edit | edit source]\nChiseled bookshelves cannot be moved by pistons.‌[Java Edition only]\nHolding books[edit | edit source]\nAll of the chiseled bookshelf textures before 22w46a.\nChiseled bookshelves can hold up to six books, books and quills, written books, enchanted books, and/or knowledge books. There is no GUI; books are instead added into the bookshelf by using on a slot with a book. Doing so places a book in that slot. Using on an occupied slot removes the book from that slot.\nChiseled bookshelves do not increase the power of enchanting tables.\nRedstone signal[edit | edit source]\nThe correspondences between slot and signal power.\nA redstone comparator sends a signal (1–6) indicating the last slot interacted with. When no slot has been interacted with yet, it outputs 0.\nAn observer can detect when a book is added or removed from the bookshelf.\nHoppers, minecarts with hopper, and droppers[edit | edit source]\nHoppers and minecart with hoppers can insert and remove books from the bookshelf. As with any other container, items are taken from the first slot that has an item that can fit in the hopper and are inserted into the first empty slot. Droppers behave similarly when inserting books into the bookshelf.\nWhen a hopper that is not already 100% full fails to remove a book from a non-empty bookshelf because there is no room for the book in the hopper's inventory, that is still counted as an \"interaction\" with the slot. Thus, a hopper that cannot remove any of the books effectively sets the last-interacted slot to the last non-empty slot in the bookshelf.[2]\nFuel[edit | edit source]\nChiseled bookshelves can be used as fuel in furnaces to smelt 1.5 items.\nNote blocks[edit | edit source]\nChiseled bookshelves can be placed under note blocks to produce a \"bass\" sound.\nSounds[edit | edit source]\nGeneric[edit |

Lightning bolts and axes can remove the oxidation on chiseled copper. Using a honeycomb on chiseled copper prevents it from oxidizing further.\nAs the block begins to oxidize (exposed), it gets discolored and green spots begin to appear. As the oxidation continues (weathered), the block is a green color with brown spots. In the last stage (oxidized), the block is teal with several green spots.\nSounds[edit | edit source]\nGeneric[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition:\n[hide]\nv t e\ncopper sound type\nSound Subtitles

They can be planted on end stone in any dimension.\nChorus flowers can be pollinated by bees.\nFarming[edit | edit source]\nChorus flowers can be planted on end stone and grow in any dimension, regardless of light level. A flower stops growing once it has reached age 5 (appearing purple rather than white), but may be harvested and replanted to reset the age. Chorus flowers do not grow if planted 1 block below the surface of the ground.\nPlacement and growth[edit | edit source]\nFinal heights of 500,000 chorus plants (blue) and heights of 500,000 chorus flowers from full-grown plants (orange).\nPlacement\nChorus flowers must be above end stone or chorus plant, or be above air and horizontally adjacent to exactly one chorus plant. If these conditions are not met, the block breaks without dropping anything.\nGrowth conditions and algorithm\nEach block tick until the flower reaches age 5, the flower attempts to grow if the block above is air. The flower does not age if growth is not attempted due to lack of an air block above. Bone meal has no effect on growth.[1]\nThe flower may attempt to grow upward depending on the structure of chorus plant blocks directly beneath:\n100% chance if zero or one plant block is directly beneath\n60% if the flower is above a two-block unbranched plant (i.e. two plant blocks over end stone)\n50% if above a two-block high branch (i.e. two plant blocks over air)\n40% if above a three-block unbranched plant\n25% if above a three-block high branch\n20% if above a four-block unbranched plant\nThe growth attempt succeeds if the blocks horizontally adjacent to and above the target block above are all air, and results in the target block becoming a flower block with the same age while the existing flower block turns to chorus plant.\nIf upward growth does not occur and the flower's age is less than 4, the flower may attempt to branch horizontally. 1–4 branches are attempted on an unbranched plant or 0–3 on a branched plant. For each branch a horizontal direction is chosen at random, and if the block in that direction is an air block with more air blocks on all other horizontal sides and an air block below, it is replaced with a flower with age incremented by 1. If at least one branch succeeds, the original flower block is turned to chorus plant.\nUpon a successful growth attempt, the chorus flower emits a low-pitched sound, similar to the sound endermen emit when teleporting.\nIf no growth occurs on a growth attempt, the flower's age is set to 5.\nFlowers and plant height\nThe amount of chorus flowers a player gets from a fully and unrestricted grown chorus plant ranges from 1 to 8, averaging at around 3.7 flowers per plant.\nPlant heights range from 5 to (rarely) 22 above the end stone block on which the original chorus flower was planted, with over half falling in the range 13–16. Flower heights range from 3 to (rarely) 22, with over half falling in the range 11–16 above the end stone block.\nBee nests[edit | edit source]\nOak, birch, and cherry trees grown from saplings that are within 2 blocks of a chorus flower have a 5% chance to grow with a bee nest and 2-3 bees in it.\nSounds[edit | edit source]\nGeneric[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition:\n[hide]\nv t e\nwood sound type\nSound Subtitles Source Description Resource location Translation key Volume Pitch Attenuation\ndistance\nBlock broken Blocks Once the block has broken block.wood.break subtitles.block.generic.break 1.0 0.8 16\nBlock placed Blocks When the block is placed block.wood.place subtitles.block.generic.place 1.0 0.8 16\nBlock breaking Blocks While the block is in the process of being broken block.wood.hit subtitles.block.generic.hit 0.25 0.5 16\nSomething falls on a block Entity-Dependent Falling on the block with fall damage block.wood.fall subtitles.block.generic.fall 0.5 0.75 16\nFootsteps Entity-Dependent Walking on the block block.wood.step subtitles.block.generic.footsteps 0.15 1.0 16\nBedrock Edition:\n[hide]\nv t e\nstone sound type\nSound Source Description Resource location Volume Pitch\nBlocks Once the block has broken dig.stone 1.0 0.8-1.0\nBlocks When the block is placed dig.stone 1.0 0.8-1.0\nBlocks While the block is in the process of being broken hit.stone 0.37 0.5\nPlayers Falling on the block with fall damage fall.stone 0.4 1.0\nPlayers Walking on the block step.stone 0.3 1.0\nBlocks Jumping from the block jump.stone 0.12 1.0\nBlocks Falling on the block without fall damage land.stone 0.22 1.0\nUnique[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition:\n[hide]\nSounds\nSound Subtitles Source Description Resource location Translation key Volume Pitch Attenuation\ndistance\nChorus Flower withers Blocks When a chorus flower dies block.chorus_flower.death subtitles.block.chorus_flower.death 1.0 1.0 16\nChorus Flower grows Blocks When a chorus flower successfully grows block.chorus_flower.grow subtitles.block.chorus_flower.grow 1.0 1.0 16\nBedrock Edition:\n[hide]\nSounds\nSound Source Description Resource location Volume Pitch\nBlocks When a chorus flower dies block.chorusflower.death 1.0 1.0\nBlocks When a chorus flower successfully grows block.chorusflower.grow 1.0 1.0\nData values[edit | edit source]\nID[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition:\nName Identifier Form\n[hide]\nTranslation key\nChorus Flower chorus_flower Block & Item\nblock.minecraft.chorus_flower\nBedrock Edition:\nName Identifier Numeric ID Form Item ID[i 1]\n[hide]\nTranslation key\nChorus Flower chorus_flower 200 Block & Giveable Item[i 2] Identical[i 3]\ntile.chorus_flower.name\n↑ ID of block's direct item form, which is used in savegame files and addons.\n↑ Available with /give command.\n↑ The block's direct item form has the same ID as the block.\nBlock states[edit | edit source]\nSee also: Block states\nJava Edition\nName Default value Allowed values\n[hide]\nDescription\nage 0 0\n1\n2\n3\n4 A freshly planted chorus flower starts at age 0.

It generates in two batches per chunk. The first batch attempts to generate 30 times per chunk in blobs of 0-37, evenly from levels 136 to 320. The second batch attempts to generate 20 times per chunk in blobs of 0-37, from levels 0 to 192, being most common at Y=96, and being less common toward either end of the range. Coal ore in this second batch is also less likely to be exposed to air: 50% of ore blocks that would generate exposed do not generate. In Bedrock Edition, coal ore also has the third batches, which attempts to generate 20 times per chunk in blobs of size 0-37, evenly from levels 128 to 256, within any type of mountains biomes.\nCoal ore can replace stone, andesite, diorite, granite, tuff, and deepslate. Deepslate coal ore generates when replacing tuff or deepslate, which is a rare occurrence due to the rarity of coal blobs below Y=8 where deepslate generates.\nCoal ore is also found in small amounts

For more information, see Breaking § Speed.\nCobblestone is dropped by stone when mined without Silk Touch, and also by infested cobblestone when mined with Silk Touch.\nNatural generation[edit | edit source]\nCobblestone occurs naturally in monster rooms, jungle pyramids, pillager outposts, ocean ruins, strongholds, plains, taiga, snowy plains, desert, and savanna villages, woodland mansions, trail ruins and in trial chambers surrounding baby zombies spawners alongside mossy cobblestone.\nIn Java Edition, a single block of cobblestone always generates at the coordinates of (8, -61, 8) at the center of the void start platform, in Superflat worlds created with the Void biome preset.\nPost-generation[edit | edit source]\nSee also: Tutorials/Cobblestone farming\nWhen water and flowing lava come into contact, the flowing lava is replaced by cobblestone. However, if the lava flows on top of the water from above, stone is created instead. Non-flowing lava (a lava source block) turns into obsidian upon contact with water, thus the requirement of flowing lava.\nUsage[edit | edit source]\nCobblestone can be used as a basic building block, as it has relatively high blast resistance and is extremely common.\nSilverfish[edit | edit source]\nSilverfish can enter and hide in cobblestone, creating an infested block.\nSmelting ingredient[edit | edit source]\nName Ingredients\n[hide]\nSmelting recipe\nStone Cobblestone +\nAny fuel\n\n\n0.1\nCrafting ingredient[edit | edit source]\nName Ingredients Crafting recipe\n[hide]\nDescription\nAndesite Diorite +\nCobblestone\n\n2\n\nBrewing Stand Blaze Rod +\nCobblestone\n\nCan use cobblestone and its other variants interchangeably.\nCoast Armor Trim Smithing Template Diamond +\nCoast Armor Trim +\nCobblestone\n\n2\nCobblestone Slab Cobblestone\n\n6\nCobblestone Stairs Cobblestone\n\n4\nCobblestone Wall Cobblestone\n\n6\nDiorite Cobblestone +\nNether Quartz\n\n2\nDispenser Cobblestone +\nBow +\nRedstone Dust\n\nThe bow can be of any durability.\nEnchantments on the bow do not affect the resulting dispenser.\nDropper Cobblestone +\nRedstone Dust\n\nFurnace Cobblestone\n\nCan use cobblestone and its other variants interchangeably.\nLever Stick +\nCobblestone\n\nMossy Cobblestone Cobblestone +\nMoss Block\n\n\nMossy Cobblestone Cobblestone +\nVines\n\n\nObserver Cobblestone +\nRedstone Dust +\nNether Quartz\n\nPiston Any Planks +\nCobblestone +\nIron Ingot +\nRedstone Dust\n\nSentry Armor Trim Smithing Template Diamond +\nSentry Armor Trim +\nCobblestone\n\n2\nAxe Cobblestone +\nStick\n\nHoe Cobblestone +\nStick\n\nPickaxe Cobblestone +\nStick\n\nShovels Cobblestone +\nStick\n\nSwords Cobblestone +\nStick\n\nVex Armor Trim Smithing Template Diamond +\nVex Armor Trim +\nCobblestone\n\n2\nStonecutting ingredient[edit | edit source]\nIngredients\n[hide]\nCutting recipe\nCobblestone\n2\nRepairing[edit | edit source]\nCobblestone is one of the repair items for the stone tier and thus can be used to repair the following items in an anvil:\nStone Sword\nStone Pickaxe\nStone Axe\nStone Shovel\nStone Hoe\nSounds[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition:\n[hide]\nv t e\nstone sound type\nSound Subtitles Source Description Resource location Translation key Volume Pitch Attenuation\ndistance\nBlock broken Blocks Once the block has broken block.stone.break subtitles.block.generic.break 1.0 0.8 16\nBlock placed Blocks When the block is placed block.stone.place subtitles.block.generic.place 1.0 0.8 16\nBlock breaking Blocks While the block is in the process of being broken block.stone.hit subtitles.block.generic.hit 0.25 0.5 16\nSomething falls on a block Entity-Dependent Falling on the block with fall damage block.stone.fall subtitles.block.generic.fall 0.5 0.75 16\nFootsteps Entity-Dependent Walking on the block block.stone.step subtitles.block.generic.footsteps 0.15 1.0 16\nBedrock Edition:\n[hide]\nv t e\nstone sound type\nSound Source Description Resource location Volume Pitch\nBlocks Once the block has broken dig.stone 1.0 0.8-1.0\nBlocks When the block is placed dig.stone 1.0 0.8-1.0\nBlocks While the block is in the process of being broken hit.stone 0.37 0.5\nPlayers Falling on the block with fall damage fall.stone 0.4 1.0\nPlayers Walking on the block step.stone 0.3 1.0\nBlocks Jumping from the block jump.stone 0.12 1.0\nBlocks Falling on the block without fall damage land.stone 0.22 1.0\nData values[edit | edit source]\nID[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition:\nName Identifier Form Block tags Item tags\n[hide]\nTranslation key\nCobblestone cobblestone Block & Item mineable/pickaxe stone_crafting_materials\nstone_tool_materials\nblock.minecraft.cobblestone\nBedrock Edition:\nName Identifier Numeric ID Form Item ID[i 1] Item tags\n[hide]\nTranslation key\nCobblestone cobblestone 4 Block & Giveable Item[i 2] Identical[i 3] minecraft:stone_crafting_materials\nminecraft:stone_tool_materials\ntile.cobblestone.name\n↑ ID of block's direct item form, which is used in savegame files and addons.\n↑ Available with /give command.\n↑ The block's direct item form has the same ID as the block.\nAchievements[edit | edit source]\n[hide]\nIcon Achievement In-game description Actual requirements (if different) Gamerscore earned Trophy type (PS)\nPS4 Other\nChestful of Cobblestone Mine 1,728 Cobblestone and place it in a chest.

Cobwebs can also be obtained with a sword enchanted with Silk Touch, which is possible only through commands or while in Creative mode‌[JE only]. A cobweb drops one piece of string if broken with a non-Silk Touch sword, if water touches or flows over it, or a piston pushes it. Breaking cobwebs costs two durability on a sword. It drops nothing when broken using anything else, or if lava flows over it.\nBlock Cobweb\nHardness 4\nBreaking time (secs)\nDefault 20\nShears 0.4\nSword 0.4\nOptions\nEfficiency\n0\nHaste\n0\nJE\nBE\nLegend\ndrops nothing\ndrops something other than the block itself\ndrops the block itself\nitalicized can be instant mined\nNatural generation[edit | edit source]\nCobwebs generate naturally in mineshafts, stronghold libraries, igloo basements, abandoned villages, woodland mansion spider spawner rooms, and trial chambers around specific trial spawners.\nPost-generation[edit | edit source]\nWhen an entity with the effect of Weaving is killed, the game attempts to place cobwebs nearby.\nUsage[edit | edit source]\nMobs can spawn inside of cobwebs. Cobwebs also diffuse sky light. Undead mobs do not catch fire from sunlight if they are under a cobweb or their head is inside a cobweb.\nBlocks can be placed on cobwebs. Paintings‌[Java Edition only] and signs can be placed on their sides, or on top in the case of signs.\nDespite being slowed down by them, mobs do not try to pathfind around cobwebs, which can be exploited to construct clever mob traps.\nRedstone circuits[edit | edit source]\n2 cobwebs delay for around a minute\nCobwebs can be used as a delaying mechanism in a redstone circuit, for example, to delay an item falling on a pressure plate or into a hopper. They can also be used to cancel random momentum of an item thrown from a dispenser or dropper by placing them directly on their face.\nEffects[edit | edit source]\nAll mobs except for spiders and cave spiders experience slow movement through a cobweb. A mob falling through a cobweb takes 13 seconds to move down 1 block. A cobweb can partially stop blast damage if a player and the entity causing the explosion are both caught in the cobweb.\nA cobweb affects the player's movement abilities, as well. While in contact with it, the player can move at a speed of about 25% of the normal walking speed, and their jumping height is severely reduced. A cobweb also limits the rate at which a player can break blocks. Like water, falling into a cobweb prevents a player from taking fall damage, meaning a fatal fall can be mitigated with cobwebs. Attacking while falling through cobwebs counts as a critical hit, the same as when falling after a jump.\nPlayers and mobs affected by the Weaving effect move through cobwebs at 50% of their normal speed instead of 25%.\nThe slowing effect of the cobweb increases if it is placed on ice. The slowest a player can move in vanilla Minecraft without commands or other third-party tools is by placing cobwebs on blue ice, sneaking, drinking a level IV Turtle Master potion, and blocking, which causes the player come to a near-total standstill, moving only a single block every few minutes.\nItems thrown into a cobweb are slowed and fall through it after a maximum of about 24 seconds depending on where it enters. They do not merge with other items of the same type thrown on the ground.\nCobwebs have different effects on other moving entities. An arrow shot at a cobweb passes through without being slowed. In Java Edition, a falling block that enters a cobweb slows down, then drops as an item after existing for 30 seconds.\nA minecart with no players in it takes about 9 seconds to fall through a cobweb if a rail is placed directly under the cobweb, however, if there is air between the cobweb and the rail, the minecart takes about 34 seconds to fall. Every extra cobweb added gives an additional 25 seconds of falling time. Players are unaffected by cobwebs when in a minecart unless they come into direct contact.\nBrewing ingredient[edit | edit source]\nName Ingredients\n[hide]\nBrewing recipe\nMundane Potion Cobweb +\nWater Bottle\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPotion of Weaving Cobweb +\nAwkward Potion\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSounds[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition:\n[hide]\nv t e\ncobweb sound type\nSound Subtitles Source Description Resource location Translation key Volume Pitch Attenuation\ndistance\nBlock broken Blocks Once the block has broken block.cobweb.break subtitles.block.generic.break 1.0 0.8 16\nBlock placed Blocks When the block is placed block.cobweb.place subtitles.block.generic.place 1.0 0.8 16\nBlock breaking Blocks While the block is in the process of being broken block.cobweb.hit subtitles.block.generic.hit 0.25 0.5 16\nSomething falls on a block Entity-Dependent Falling on the block with fall damage block.cobweb.fall subtitles.block.generic.fall 0.5 0.75 16\nFootsteps Entity-Dependent Walking on the block block.cobweb.step subtitles.block.generic.footsteps 0.15 1.0 16\nBedrock Edition:\n[hide]\nv t e\nweb sound type\nSound Source Description Resource location Volume Pitch\nBlocks Once the block has broken break.web 1.0 1.0\nBlocks When the block is placed break.web 1.0 1.0\nBlocks While the block is in the process of being broken step.web 0.9 0.7\nBlocks Falling on the block with fall damage step.web 1.0 1.0\nBlocks Walking on the block step.web 1.0 1.0\nBlocks Jumping from the block step.web 0.12 1.1\nBlocks Falling on the block without fall damage step.web 1.0 1.0\nData values[edit | edit source]\nID[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition:\nName Identifier Form\n[hide]\nTranslation key\nCobweb cobweb Block & Item\nblock.minecraft.cobweb\nBedrock Edition:\nName Identifier Numeric ID Form Item ID[i 1]\n[hide]\nTranslation key\nCobweb web 30 Block & Giveable Item[i 2] Identical[i 3]\ntile.web.name\n↑ ID of block's direct item form, which is used in savegame files and addons.\n↑ Available with /give command.\n↑ The block's direct item form has the same ID as the block.\nHistory[edit | edit source]\n[hide]\nJava Edition Classic\nOctober 23, 2009 Notch originally planned for spiders to produce webs.\n0.26_SURVIVAL_TEST A cobweb texture has been added to terrain.png.

The log does not need to be attached to a tree. A cocoa pod can be placed on jungle logs, jungle wood, stripped jungle logs and stripped jungle wood.\nCocoa has three stages of growth. During its first stage, the pod is small and green. In the second stage, the plant is bigger and colored tan. In its last stage, the pod is even larger and orange. The cocoa block has a 20% chance to grow a stage when receiving a random tick, giving it an average time of 5 minutes and 41 seconds per stage. When destroyed in the first two stages, the pod yields only one cocoa bean. When destroyed in the third stage, it gives 3 cocoa beans. Bone meal can be used to force the cocoa pod forward by one growth stage.

Because it cannot be obtained or used in Survival mode without cheats, it is primarily used in multiplayer servers, Creative worlds, and custom maps.\nAn impulse command block is the default block type; it executes only once when activated.\nA chain command block executes every time when triggered.\nA repeating command block executes every game tick as long as it is activated.\nContents\n1 Obtaining\n2 Usage\n2.1 Modification\n2.2 Activation\n2.3 Execution\n2.3.1 Trigger and chaining\n2.4 Output\n2.4.1 Success count\n2.4.2 Message\n2.5 Notes\n2.5.1 Easter eggs\n2.6 Piston interactivity\n3 Sounds\n4 Data values\n4.1 ID\n4.2 Block states\n4.3 Block data\n5 History\n5.1 Data history\n6 Issues\n7 Gallery\n7.1 Mojang images\n7.2 In other media\n8 References\n9 External links\n10 Navigation\nObtaining[edit | edit source]\nIn Java Edition, command blocks are available in the Creative inventory under the \"Operator Utilities\" tab, if the \"Operator Items Tab\" setting in the \"Controls\" Options tab is set to \"ON\". Across both Java and Bedrock editions, they can either be obtained by using various commands, such as /give @s minecraft:command_block or /setblock ~ ~ ~ command_block, or by pressing the pick block control on an existing command block. Just like other blocks that can store NBT data, using pick block + CTRL copies the command and options inside the command block. This allows it to be placed elsewhere without having to re-enter the data inside.\nCommand blocks are not flammable, and have the same blast resistance as bedrock. Command blocks, structure blocks, and jigsaw blocks cannot be mined in Survival.\nCommand blocks cannot be placed by a non-operator player.\nUsage[edit | edit source]\nSee also: Commands and Tutorials/Command blocks and functions\nA command block can execute commands when activated by redstone power. It always has permissions of level 2‌[Java Edition only]/level 1‌[Bedrock Edition only], so it can be used to allow a specific use of a command by players who can't use that command in general (for example, allowing anyone to obtain a specific item with /give without allowing everyone to /give themselves whatever they want).\nA command block has an orientation that determines the chain command block to activate, and the blocks to be checked to see if a command block in \"Conditional\" mode executes.\nTo execute the command, in Java Edition in multiplayer enable-command-block in the server.properties file must be set to true (default is false); in Bedrock Edition \"Command Blocks Enabled\" in options must be enabled.\nModification[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition command block GUI\nTo enter command or modify the command block, use the Use Item control on the command block to open the command block GUI (graphical user interface). The GUI opens only if the player is in Creative mode, and has the proper permissions. That means, in singleplayer, \"Allow Cheats\"‌[JE only] or \"Activate Cheats\"‌[BE only] in options must be enabled. In multiplayer, GUI can be opened only by operators in Creative mode, and in Java Edition op-permission-level in the server.properties file must be set to 2 or above (default is 4).\nIn Java Edition to enter command or modify the command block, enable-command-block in the server.properties file must be set to true (default is false).\nBedrock edition command block GUI\nIn Java Edition, opening the GUI in singleplayer pauses the game.\nConsole Command‌[JE only]/Command Input‌[BE only]\nCommands can be entered in the top text pane. The text limit for commands in a command block is 32,500 characters, but the text pane can show only a small portion of this amount at a time.\nCommands in a command block do not need to be prefixed with the forward-slash (/) as they do in the chat window, but doing so still works.\nPress Tab ↹ to complete words or cycle through options.\nIn Bedrock Edition, below the console command text pane are some reminder tips about how to use target selectors.\nPrevious Output\nThe bottom text pane displays the output message (success or failure) of the last executed command (it is blank‌[JE only] or \" - \"‌[BE only] initially). Its text is not editable.\nA button to the right of the Previous Output text pane‌[JE only] or the left of the \"Previous Output\"‌[BE only] specifies whether the last output should be stored and displayed. It is O‌[JE only]/enabled‌[BE only] when the output text should be stored and X‌[JE only]/disabled‌[BE only] when the output text should not be stored. For worlds with many command blocks, especially command blocks running on fast clocks, not storing the output text can reduce memory and storage requirements.\nIf gamerule sendCommandFeedback is true (the default), default to O‌[JE only]/enabled‌[BE only]. Otherwise defaults to X‌[JE only]/disabled‌[BE only].\nBlock Type\nLeft: \"Impulse\" block type.\nMiddle: \"Chain\" block type.\nRight: \"Repeating\" block type.\nTop: \"Unconditional\" mode.\nBottom: \"Conditional\" mode.\nClick the \"Impulse/Chain/Repeat\" button‌[JE only]/\"Block Type:\" dropdown menu‌[BE only] to change the command block's type. The default state is \"Impulse\", but non-default command blocks can be obtained and placed. The command block also changes color when changing its command block type:\n\"Impulse\" command blocks are orange. They execute once every time they are activated.\n\"Chain\" command blocks are cyan. They execute once every time they are triggered if they have been activated.\n\"Repeat\" command blocks are purple. They execute their commands once every one game tick (or more‌[BE only]) as long as they are activated.\nCondition\nClick the \"Conditional/Unconditional\" button‌[JE only]/\"Condition:\" dropdown menu‌[BE only] to change the command block's conditional behavior:\n\"Conditional\": A command block in conditional mode executes its command only when the command block behind it has executed successfully (\"Success count\" is greater than 0).\n\"Unconditional\" (default): A command block in unconditional mode executes its command even if there's a command block behind it that didn't execute its command successfully.\n\"Behind it\" in the sense of opposite to the direction the command block is facing, regardless of chain direction or even if chaining is occurring.\nRedstone\nClick the \"Always Active/Needs Redstone\" button‌[JE only]/\"Redstone:\" dropdown menu‌[BE only] to change the command block's activation requirements:\n\"Needs Redstone\" (the default for impulse and repeat command blocks): A command block in the \"Needs Redstone\" setting can be activated only with redstone.\n\"Always Active\" (the default for chain command blocks): The command block is activated when set to \"Always Active\". Then it is always active even without redstone activation.\nExecute on First Tick‌[BE only]\nSpecifies whether a repeat command block executes its command as soon as it is activated. If it's disabled, executes the first time after the delay from the time when it is activated.\nDelay in Ticks‌[BE only]\nFor impulse or chain command block, specifies how many game ticks it delays before executing a command after it is activated or triggered.\nFor repeat command block, specifies how many game ticks it delays to execute again.\nNote that for impulse or repeat command block, 0 and 1 work the same; the game takes 0 as 1. However, For chain command block, 0 and 1 are different.\nHover Note‌[BE only]\nSpecifies the name of the command block, which can be seen when you point to the block. It is also used for message commands. If the command block had been named in an anvil before placement, that name is used as well. If it is empty, defaults to !.\nDone\nIn Java Edition, click the \"Done\" button or Enter to save the command and leave the command block GUI.\nIn Bedrock Edition, close the GUI to save the command and changes.\nCancel\nClick the \"Cancel\" button or Esc‌[JE only]to leave the command block GUI without saving any changes.\nActivation[edit | edit source]\nCommand blocks are redstone mechanisms and can be activated by:\nAn adjacent active power component: for example, a lever, a block of redstone, a daylight sensor, a button etc.\nAn adjacent powered block (for example, an opaque block with an active redstone torch under it)\nA powered redstone comparator or redstone repeater facing the mechanism component\nPowered redstone dust configured to point at the command block (or on top of it) or directionless; a command block is not activated by adjacent powered redstone dust that is configured to point away from it.\nA command block can also be activated by setting it to \"Always Active\" mode.\nWhen activated, a command block executes its command, depending on the command block's type:\nAn impulse command block executes its command once.\nA chain command block does not execute its command until it is triggered.\nA repeat command block executes its command once every one game tick (or more‌[BE only]) until no longer activated.\nExecution[edit | edit source]\nAn impulse command block, when it is activated, checks whether the command block behind it has executed successfully (if in conditional mode). After the delay of 1 game tick (or more‌[BE only]), if the condition is met before the delay (if in \"Conditional\" mode), it executes its command once and triggers the chain command block it is pointing to.\nA repeat command block, when it is activated, after 1 game tick (always 1 no matter how many \"Delay in Ticks\" is), checks whether the command block behind it has executed successfully (if in conditional mode). If the condition is met, and if \"Execute on First Tick\" is enabled in Bedrock Edition, it executes its command once and triggers the chain command block it is pointing to. If it is still activated, it then checks, executes, and triggers the chain command block again after 1 game tick (or more‌[BE only]).\nWhen executing a command, it also updates its success count: If in \"Conditional\" mode, if the command block behind it didn't execute successfully, it sets its success count to 0. Otherwise, it sets it to the success count of the command.\nAlso:\nWhen an impulse or repeat command block in \"Needs Redstone\" mode with a command is placed or is cloned by a command to a powered location, the new command block executes its command only if it hasn't been activated with redstone. In Java Edition, it also needs a block update to execute its command.\nWhen an impulse or repeat command block in \"Always Active\" mode with a command is placed or is cloned by a command to a powered location, the new command block executes its command only if it hasn't been activated with redstone.\nWhen an impulse or chain command block is set to \"Repeat\", if it has been activated, checks whether the command block behind it has executed successfully (if in conditional mode). After 1 game tick (always 1 no matter how many \"Delay in Ticks\" is), if the condition is met, it executes its command once and triggers the chain command block it is pointing to. Then it checks, executes, and triggers the chain command block again after 1 game tick (or more‌[BE only]).\nTrigger and chaining[edit | edit source]\nIf any command block having executed its command (whether successfully or unsuccessfully) faces a chain command block, it triggers the chain command block to also attempt execution.\nWhen a chain command block is triggered,\nIf it has been activated,\nIt checks whether it is in \"Conditional\" mode and the command block behind it hasn't executed successfully (Behind in the sense of the direction it is facing, not in the sense of which command block chained to it),\nIf true, it triggers another chain command block it is facing, without executing the command.\nIf false, it checks whether it has been already executed in this game tick. If false, it executes the command and triggers another chain command block it is facing. If true, it does nothing. That means that chained execution cannot be passed to a command block that has already executed in that game tick (loops execute only once).\nIf it has not been activated, it triggers the chain command block it is facing to attempt execution.\nChained command blocks execute simultaneously in the same game tick in the order they are chained.\nIn Bedrock Edition, it can also delay before executing commands if \"Delay in Ticks\" is not 0:\nWhen it is triggered,\nIf it has been activated, the chain command block checks whether the command block behind it has executed successfully (if in conditional mode), then it delays.\nAfter a delay, if the condition is met before the delay (if in \"Conditional\" mode), it executes its command once and triggers the chain command block it is pointing to no matter whether the condition met.\nIf it has not been activated, it triggers (without delay) the chain command block it is facing to attempt execution.\nIn Java Edition, it can execute multiple times in the same game tick if \"UpdateLastExecution\" is set to false. In this case, it does not check whether it has already executed in this game tick.\nIf the chain command block has been activated when triggered, it also updates its success count: If in \"Conditional\" mode, if the command block behind it didn't execute successfully, it sets its success count to 0. Otherwise, it sets it to the success count of the command.\nOutput[edit | edit source]\nWhen activated, a command block can produce multiple types of output:\nSuccess count[edit | edit source]\nA command block can power a redstone comparator facing away from it (possibly separated by a block) with signal strength specific to the success count. Success count is an integer between 0 to 2,147,483,647 (inclusive).\nThe signal strength always reflects the last command executed, even after the command block is deactivated.\nIn Java Edition, success count is usually 0 or 1, except for /function and /execute.\nIn Bedrock Edition, success count is an integer related to the command (e.g., the number of players affected by the command, the number of blocks that were altered, the value returned by the command, etc.)\nIn Java Edition, leaving the command block GUI by clicking \"Done\" or pressing Enter resets the success count to 0, regardless of whether changes were made in the GUI. In Bedrock Edition, leaving the GUI with changes resets the success count to 0.\nMessage[edit | edit source]\nThe output message describes the success or failure of the executed command, and may be written to multiple destinations:\nPrevious Output: The output message is always written to the \"Previous Output\" text pane of the command block GUI.\nChat: The output message is written to the chat text in singleplayer mode, or broadcast to all other ops in multiplayer mode, unless it has been suppressed with /gamerule commandBlockOutput false. Some commands may write additional text to the chat as their normal function, which won't be suppressed (for example, the /say command writes a message to the chat of all players), separate from the output message. Chat messages that would usually be prefaced by a player's name (such as from the /me, /say and /tell commands) use @ ‌[Java Edition only] / ! ‌[Bedrock Edition only] as the player name. If the command block had been named in an anvil before placement, that name is used instead. In Bedrock Edition, it can also modified in the GUI.\nLogs: The output message is written to multiplayer server logs unless it has been suppressed with /gamerule logAdminCommands false.\nNotes[edit | edit source]\nCommand blocks execute commands with OP level 2. The following commands cannot be used in a command block: /ban, /banlist, /ban-ip, /debug, /deop, /kick‌[JE only], /op, /pardon, /pardon-ip, /publish, /reload‌[BE only], /save-all, /save-off, /save-on, /stop, /tick and /whitelist (i.e., /debug, /publish, and all of the multiplayer-only commands except /list).\nEaster eggs[edit | edit source]\nMain article: Easter eggs § Command blocks\nRunning \"Searge\" (case insensitive) as the command in the command block without a preceding \"/\" will set the previous output to \"#itzlipofutzli\". Its success count is 1.\nPiston interactivity[edit | edit source]\nCommand blocks cannot be pushed by pistons.

For more information, see Breaking § Speed.\nNatural generation[edit | edit source]\nComposters generate in village farms. They can also generate in trail ruins.\nCrafting[edit | edit source]\nIngredients\n[hide]\nCrafting recipe\nAny Wooden Slab\n\nUsage[edit | edit source]\nComposters can be used to recycle a selection of food and plant items into bone meal. To do so, the player must use any of a selection of items on the composter. When an adjacent comparator is facing away from the composter, a comparator signal strength of up to 8 is emitted depending on the fullness of the block.\nComposters appear to have an empty interior. As such, entities can enter and exit a composter through the top, but not the sides or bottom. The composter has a \"floor\", whose height depends on the fullness. When the composter is completely empty, this floor is slightly above the block below, and when it is completely full, there is a slight dip on top. In Bedrock Edition, when the composter’s fullness increases, any entities inside are pushed up accordingly.\nComposting[edit | edit source]\nThe composter can be filled with compost, which is done by adding compostable items to it. When successfully adding an item, a green particle () appears. The table below lists supported items, which have different levels of compostability. The higher the percentage of an item, the more likely it is for it to add another layer of compost. However, when the composter is empty, any compostable item added always creates the first layer of compost, regardless of its compostability.[1] Each layer of compost has a podzol-like appearance. When the composter reaches the 7th layer of compost, the compost changes appearance indicating that bone meal can be collected by using the composter a final time or by breaking the composter.\nThe following table shows the items that can be used in a composter, the percent chance for an item to add a level of compost, and the average number of items needed to fill a composter. Smaller pieces (individual pieces of wheat, melon slices, etc.) produce more compost than the blocks or other items that can be made from them. The exception is cookies, because each recipe produces 8 cookies, and together those give more than 3 times the compost.\nDespite being plants, it is not possible to compost bamboo,[2] dead bushes,[3] poisonous potatoes[4] and chorus plant products.[5] Meat items, fish, and bones are also not compostable.[6]\nInteracting with a Composter while holding a Debug Stick will raise the level by one, the debug stick is not consumed.\nComposting chance (per item)\n30% 50% 65% 85% 100%\nItems\nBeetroot Seeds\nBush[upcoming JE 1.21.5]\nCactus Flower[upcoming JE 1.21.5]\nDried Kelp\nFirefly Bush[upcoming JE 1.21.5]\nGlow Berries\nGrass Block‌[BE only][7]\nHanging Roots\nKelp\nLeaves\nLeaf Litter[upcoming JE 1.21.5]\nMangrove Propagule\nMangrove Roots\nMelon Seeds\nMoss Carpet\nPale Hanging Moss\nPale Moss Carpet\nPink Petals\nPitcher Pod\nPumpkin Seeds\nSaplings\nSeagrass\nShort Grass\nShort Dry Grass[upcoming JE 1.21.5]\nSmall Dripleaf\nSweet Berries\nTall Dry Grass[upcoming JE 1.21.5]\nTorchflower Seeds\nWheat Seeds\nCactus\nDried Kelp Block\nFlowering Azalea Leaves\nGlow Lichen\nMelon Slice\nNether Sprouts\nSugar Cane\nTall Grass\nTwisting Vines\nVines\nWeeping Vines\nApple\nAzalea\nBeetroot\nBig Dripleaf\nCarrot\nCocoa Beans\nFern\nFlowers\nFungi\nLarge Fern\nLily Pad\nMelon\nMoss Block\nMushrooms\nMushroom Stem\nNether Wart\nPale Moss Block\nPotato\nPumpkins\nCrimson Roots\nWarped Roots\nSea Pickle\nShroomlight\nSpore Blossom\nWheat\nWither Rose\nBaked Potato\nBread\nCookie\nFlowering Azalea\nHay Bale\nMushroom Blocks\nNether Wart Block\nPitcher Plant\nTorchflower\nWarped Wart Block\nCake\nPumpkin Pie\nAverage number of items to complete compost\n23.333 14.00 10.769 8.235 7.00\nAverage compost yield (per stack)\n2.742 4.571 5.943 7.771 9.143\nProfession[edit | edit source]\nMain article: Job site block\nIf a composter has not been claimed by a villager, any nearby unemployed villager has a chance to change their profession to farmer and claim the composter as their job site block. Also, farmer villagers can use composter to compost.[8]\nRedstone component[edit | edit source]\nSee also: Redstone circuit\nA composter can act as a power source for a redstone comparator. With a composter behind it (either directly, or separated by an unpowered solid block), a comparator outputs a signal strength between 0 and 8, proportional to how full the composter is: 0 for empty, 1 for 1⁄7 full, 2 for 2⁄7 full, and so on to 6. 7 is for completely full but the bone meal is not ready to collect, and 8 for completely full and the bone meal is ready to collect. However, if there is a block between the composter and comparator, the comparator does not immediately update.\nHoppers[edit | edit source]\nComposters can interact with hoppers. A hopper directly below a composter pulls bone meal from it. A hopper or dropper facing downward directly above a composter pushes items into it. See Hopper § Redstone component for more details.\nHoppers cannot interact with the sides of a composter.\nFuel[edit | edit source]\nA composter can be used as fuel in a furnace to smelt 1.5 items.\nNote blocks[edit | edit source]\nComposters can be placed under note blocks to produce \"bass\" sounds.\nSounds[edit | edit source]\nGeneric[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition:\n[hide]\nv t

Notice the sand block falls through the water, while the concrete powder instantly solidifies on contact with water. (Click for bigger image)\nConcrete is formed when concrete powder comes into contact with a block of water (source block, flowing or waterlogged). If next to a waterlogged block, it must be adjacent to the sides where water can flow out from, such as the open sides of stairs, but not the back side of stairs or any sides of waterlogged leaves.\nRenewability[edit | edit source]\nConcrete is renewable as all of the crafting ingredients of concrete powder are renewable. However, without glitches, sand is only renewably obtained through the wandering trader, which spawns infrequently and only allows a limited number of trades per spawn, making it impractical to obtain it (and by extension, concrete) through only renewable means.\nUsage[edit | edit source]\nThe bright and solid colors of concrete make it useful for decoration. It has more pronounced colors than terracotta, and unlike wool, is not flammable.\nAs a building material, its hardness is slightly higher than stone, but its blast resistance is significantly lower.[1]\nNote blocks[edit | edit source]\nConcrete can be placed under note blocks to produce \"bass drum\" sound.\nSounds[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition:\n[hide]\nv t e\nstone sound type\nSound

Cement serves as a binding material, that binds sand and gravel together. In Minecraft, dye is used instead of cement. It is possible that cement is made at the same time from sand and gravel, if the gravel contains limestone, because limestone and sand are real life ingredients for cement.\nA black concrete block is considered the blackest block in Minecraft.\nGallery[edit | edit source]\nScreenshots[edit | edit source]\nThe first image of concrete, tweeted by Jens Bergensten, comparing it to the new wool palette.\nA square of black concrete.\nIn other media[edit | edit source]\nKai, Makena, and Steve building with red concrete.\nMakena places black concrete.\nSeveral concrete blocks used in the shape of the Microsoft logo, used for the 15th anniversary of Minecraft; referred to as a \"small company.\"[4]\nReferences[edit | edit source]\n↑ MC-199580 — Blocks added in 1.12 have oddly low blast resistances — resolved as \"Works As Intended\".\n↑ \"It comes in 16 different colors\" – @jeb_ (Jens Bergensten) on X (formerly Twitter), February 2, 2017\n↑ MC-118153\n↑ https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/15th-anniversary\nExternal links[edit | edit source]\n\"Block of the Week: Concrete\" – minecraft.net, March 9, 2018.\nNavigation[edit | edit source]\n[hide]\nv t e\nBlocks\n[show]\nStructural\n[hide]\nOrnamental\nDecorative Bookshelf Crying Obsidian Gilded Blackstone Honeycomb Block Reinforced Deepslate\nPartial blocks Chain Dirt Path Fences Wooden Nether Brick Iron Bars Slabs Cut Copper Wooden Stairs Cut Copper Wooden Walls\nDyeable/Dyed Wool Carpets Terracotta Stained Glazed Concrete Powder Glass Pane Tinted Stained Glass Pane\nLighting Candle Dyed End Rod Froglight Glowstone Jack o'Lantern Lantern Soul Sea Lantern Torch Soul\nBE & edu only Colored Torches Elements Hardened Glass Pane Hardened Stained Glass Pane\n[show]\nNatural\n[show]\nUtility\n[show]\nCreative or commands only\n[show]\nUnused\n[show]\nUnimplemented\n[show]\nJoke features\n[show]\nRemoved",

However, without glitches, sand is only renewably obtained through the wandering trader, which spawns infrequently and only allows a limited number of trades per spawn. Therefore concrete powder is more easily obtained by simply harvesting sand from any biome it generates in.\nUsage[edit | edit source]\nNormal sand falls through the water, while one of the pink concrete powder blocks solidifies immediately on contact with the water.\nConcrete powder falls when there is a non-solid block beneath it.\nCreating concrete[edit | edit source]\nMain article: Concrete\nIf a concrete powder block comes into contact with water, it solidifies into a block of concrete. Specifically, the block has to be placed into, placed next to, or fall into flowing water, a water source block, or a waterlogged block. If placed next to a waterlogged block, it must be adjacent to the sides where water can flow out from, such as the open sides of stairs, but not the back side of stairs or any sides of waterlogged leaves. It does not solidify in midair falling past water. If it lands next to water, it solidifies only after a block update. Rain or splash water bottles also have no effect on concrete powder. Concrete powder in item form also does not become concrete. Concrete powder placed directly at water makes the placement sound of concrete.\nNote blocks[edit | edit source]\nConcrete powder can be placed under note blocks to produce \"snare drum\"

The block states of the block.\n[String] Name: The block state name and its value.\n[Byte] CancelDrop: 1 or 0 (true/false) - true if the block should be destroyed instead of placed after landing on a solid block. When true, the block is not dropped as an item, even if the DropItem tag is set to true. However, if the entity is deleted due to its Time value being too high, this tag is ignored and an item is dropped depending on the DropItem tag. CancelDrop defaults to 1 for falling suspicious sand and suspicious gravel, and 0 for the other vanilla falling blocks and any summoned falling block.\n[Byte] DropItem: 1 or 0 (true/false) – true if the block should drop as an item when it breaks. Any block that does not have an item form with the same ID as the block does not drop even if this is set.\n[Float] FallHurtAmount: Multiplied by the FallDistance to calculate the amount of damage to inflict. By default this value is 2HP for anvils, and 6HP for pointed dripstone.\n[Int] FallHurtMax: The maximum hit points of damage to inflict on entities that intersect this falling block. For vanilla falling blocks, always 40HP × 20.\n[Byte] HurtEntities: 1 or 0 (true/false) – true if the block should hurt entities it falls on.

Click the scale on the right to view the layers. The conduit and water are required. The frame must include 16-42 blocks of prismarine, dark prismarine, sea lanterns, and/or prismarine bricks. Unused frame-blocks and empty spaces can be anything.\nWhen activated, conduits give the \"Conduit Power\" effect to all players in contact with rain or water, within a spherical range of 32-96 blocks. This effect restores oxygen, gives underwater night vision and increases mining speed by 16.7% (1/6th). Conduits also damage any hostile mobs, like drowned, guardians, and elder guardians, within a range of 8 blocks of the conduit. Conduits can be activated in any biome and at any height or depth.\nTo activate, a conduit needs to be in the center of a 3×3×3 volume of water (26 source blocks, flowing water, and/or waterlogged blocks, with the conduit in the center), which must be enclosed within an activation frame. The frame can be built out of blocks in three 5×5 open squares centered on the conduit, one around each axis. Only prismarine, dark prismarine, prismarine bricks, and sea lantern blocks in the frame contribute to activation. A minimum of 16 blocks are required and produce an effective range of 32 blocks. Prismarine-type slabs (including double slabs), stairs, and walls cannot be used to activate the conduit. Any blocks (of any type) that are not part of the activation frame itself but are in the 5×5×5 outer shell likewise have no effect. Once activated, removing any blocks from the conduit (frame blocks) deactivates the conduit.[note 1]\nThe effective radius of the conduit is 16 blocks for every seven blocks in the frame, though the effect does not activate until the minimum of 16 blocks is included in the build. Thus, it extends to 48 at 21 blocks, 64 at 28 blocks, 80 at 35 blocks, and 96 with a complete frame of 42 blocks. When the frame is complete, the center of the conduit displays an orange iris-like shape.\nAttacking mobs[edit | edit source]\nA complete frame also carries the additional advantage of damaging hostile mobs within 8 blocks of the conduit, dealing 4HP magic damage every 2 seconds, if they are in contact with water or rain.[note 2]\nMonsters that are attacked by the conduit:\nBlaze\nBogged\nBreeze\nCave Spider\nCreaking\nCreeper\nDrowned\nElder Guardian\nEnder Dragon\nEnderman\nEndermite\nEvoker\nGhast\nGiant ‌[JE only]\nGuardian\nHoglin\nHusk\nIllusioner ‌[JE only]\nMagma Cube\nPhantom\nPiglin\nPiglin Brute\nPillager\nRavager\nShulker\nSilverfish\nSkeleton\nSkeleton Horse ‌[BE only]\nSlime\nSpider\nStray\nVex\nVindicator\nWarden\nWitch\nWither\nWither Skeleton\nZoglin\nZombie\nZombie Horse ‌[BE only]\nZombie Villager\nZombified Piglin\nLight source[edit | edit source]\nConduits emit a light level of 15, the brightest light level in the game, whether activated or not, and even on land.\nSounds[edit | edit source]\nGeneric[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition:\n[hide]\nv t e\nstone sound type\nSound Subtitles Source Description Resource location Translation key Volume Pitch Attenuation\ndistance\nBlock broken Blocks Once the block has broken block.stone.break subtitles.block.generic.break 1.0 0.8 16\nBlock placed Blocks When the block is placed block.stone.place subtitles.block.generic.place 1.0 0.8 16\nBlock breaking Blocks While the block is in the process of being broken block.stone.hit subtitles.block.generic.hit 0.25 0.5 16\nSomething falls on a block Entity-Dependent Falling on the block with fall damage block.stone.fall subtitles.block.generic.fall 0.5 0.75 16\nFootsteps Entity-Dependent Walking on the block block.stone.step subtitles.block.generic.footsteps 0.15 1.0 16\nBedrock Edition:\n[hide]\nv t e\nstone sound type\nSound Source Description Resource location Volume Pitch\nBlocks Once the block has broken dig.stone 1.0 0.8-1.0\nBlocks When the block is placed dig.stone 1.0 0.8-1.0\nBlocks While the block is in the process of being broken hit.stone 0.37 0.5\nPlayers Falling on the block with fall damage fall.stone 0.4 1.0\nPlayers Walking on the block step.stone 0.3 1.0\nBlocks Jumping from the block jump.stone 0.12 1.0\nBlocks Falling on the block without fall damage land.stone 0.22 1.0\nUnique[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition:\n[hide]\nSounds\nSound Subtitles Source Description Resource location Translation key Volume Pitch Attenuation\ndistance\nConduit activates Blocks When a conduit activates block.conduit.activate subtitles.block.conduit.activate 0.9 1.0 16\nConduit pulses Blocks While a conduit is active block.conduit.ambient subtitles.block.conduit.ambient 1.0 1.0 8\nNone[sound 1] Blocks Periodically every 3–5 seconds while active block.conduit.ambient.short None[sound 1] 1.0 1.0 8\nConduit attacks Blocks When a conduit attacks something block.conduit.attack.target subtitles.block.conduit.attack.target 1.0 1.0 16\nConduit deactivates Blocks When a conduit deactivates block.conduit.deactivate subtitles.block.conduit.deactivate 0.7 1.0 16\n↑\na b MC-218104\nBedrock Edition:\n[hide]\nSounds\nSound Source Description Resource location Volume Pitch\nBlocks When a conduit activates conduit.activate 1.0 1.0\nBlocks While a conduit is active conduit.ambient 1.0 1.0\nBlocks Randomly while active conduit.short 1.0 1.0\nBlocks When a conduit attacks something conduit.attack 1.0 1.0\nBlocks When a conduit deactivates[sound 1] conduit.deactivate 1.0 1.0\n↑ MCPE-128117\nData values[edit | edit source]\nID[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition:\nName Identifier Form Block tags\n[hide]\nTranslation key\nConduit conduit Block & Item mineable/pickaxe\nblock.minecraft.conduit\nName\n[hide]\nIdentifier\nBlock entity conduit\nBedrock Edition:\nName Identifier Numeric ID Form Item ID[i 1]\n[hide]\nTranslation key\nConduit conduit 412 Block & Giveable Item[i 2] Identical[i 3]\ntile.conduit.name\n↑ ID of block's direct item form, which is used in savegame files and addons.\n↑ Available with /give command.\n↑ The block's direct item form has the same ID as the block.\nName\n[hide]\nSavegame ID\nBlock entity Conduit\nBlock states[edit | edit source]\nSee also: Block states\nJava Edition:\nName Default value Allowed values\n[hide]\nDescription\nwaterlogged true false\ntrue Whether or not there's water in the same place as this conduit.\nBlock entity[edit | edit source]\nA conduit has a block entity associated with it that holds additional data about the block.\nJava Edition:\nSee also: Block entity format\n[NBT Compound / JSON Object] Block entity data\nTags common to all block entities[show]\n[Int Array] Target: The UUID of the hostile mob the conduit is currently attacking, stored as four ints.

When the copper bulb receives a redstone pulse, it instantly toggles between its lit and unlit states.\nRedstone component[edit | edit source]\nA comparator can read the state of a copper bulb, and it emits a signal strength of 15 if the bulb is lit, regardless of oxidation. If the bulb is unlit, the comparator does not emit any power, allowing this comparator and copper bulb combination to act as a compact T flip-flop.\nWhile the copper bulb is receiving redstone power (either to toggle the bulb on or off) a red dot appears in the center of the block. An observer can detect this, and emits a signal when a copper bulb becomes powered or unpowered.\nOxidation[edit | edit source]\nMain article: Oxidation\nNon-waxed copper bulbs have four stages of oxidation (including the initial normal state). Lightning bolts and axes can remove the oxidation on copper bulbs.

Copper doors are also affected by the wind burst of thrown wind charges, causing them to open if closed, or vice versa.\nIn Hard difficulty, copper doors can be broken by vindicators and all variants of zombies except drowned.\nBarrier[edit | edit source]\nA vindicator breaking a closed copper door placed sideways, even though it allows passage\nA copper door can be opened or closed by pressing the Use Item/Place Block control. When a door opens or closes, it immediately changes its orientation without affecting anything in the space it \"swings through\".\nSome zombies can break copper doors in Hard difficulty. Zombies have a 5% chance to spawn with the ability to break doors. Vindicators spawned from a raid in Normal and Hard difficulty can also break copper doors, but they do so only to reach targeted players, villagers, or wandering traders. In Java Edition, some vindicators may sometimes open a copper door instead of breaking it. Both zombies and vindicators attempt to break a copper door only when the door is in its \"closed\" state; this is the case even when the door is placed in such a way as to allow passage in its \"closed\" state and block passage in its \"open\" state (for example, by facing sideways when placing the door).\nRedstone component[edit | edit source]\nSee also: Redstone circuit\nCopper doors can be controlled with redstone power.\nA copper door is a redstone mechanism component and can be activated by weakly powering any cardinally adjacent block.\nWhen activated, the copper door immediately opens. When deactivated, it immediately closes. Players and mobs can still open and close a door that is controlled by a redstone signal.\nAll methods of activating a door can be applied to either the top or bottom parts of a door.\nOxidation[edit | edit source]\nMain article: Oxidation\nNon-waxed copper doors have four stages of oxidation (including the initial normal state).[2] Lightning bolts and axes can remove the oxidation on copper doors. They can be waxed with honeycomb to prevent oxidation from progressing.\nAs the block begins to oxidize (exposed), it gets discolored and green spots begin to appear. As the oxidation continues (weathered), the block is a green color with brown spots. In the last stage (oxidized), the block is teal with several green spots.\nAir pockets[edit | edit source]\nCopper doors can be used as air pockets underwater in Java Edition. They can also be used as air pockets in lava in both Java and Bedrock editions, similarly to iron doors.\nSounds[edit | edit source]\nGeneric[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition:\n[hide]\nv t e\ncopper

Copper grates do not conduct redstone, and mobs cannot spawn on top of them. They can also be waterlogged, and smoke travels through them.\nCopper grates adjacent to other copper grates are invisible when viewed through a copper grate that is identical in states of oxidation and wax.\nOxidation[edit | edit source]\nMain article: Oxidation\nNon-waxed copper grates have four stages of oxidation (including the initial normal state). Lightning bolts and axes can remove the oxidation on copper grates. Using a honeycomb on a copper grate prevents it from oxidizing.\nAs the block begins to oxidize (exposed), it gets discolored and green spots begin to appear. As the oxidation continues (weathered), the block is a green color with brown spots. In the last stage (oxidized), the block is teal with several green spots.\nSounds[edit | edit source]\nGeneric[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition:\n[hide]\nv t e\ncopper_grate sound type\nSound

Copper ore generate in two batches, the first batch generate anywhere on the overworld biomes except dripstone caves 16 times per chunks in groups from 0 to 16, in layer -16 to 112, being most common in layers 47 and 48 and less common at the ends. The second batch generate only in dripstone caves 16 times per chunks in groups from 0 to 52, in layer -16 to 112, being most common in layers 47 and 48 and less common at the ends.\nCopper ore can replace stone, andesite, diorite, granite, tuff, and deepslate. Copper ore that replaces tuff or deepslate becomes deepslate copper ore.\nIt can also spawn rare ore veins above Y=0, mixed with granite and the occasional raw copper blocks. In dripstone caves biomes, copper ore veins are larger on average.\nUsage[edit | edit source]\nCopper ore is smelted to obtain copper ingots, which are crafting ingredients for blocks of copper, spyglasses, and lightning rods. Copper ore does not weather like its block counterpart, though the ore itself shows some oxidation.\nSmelting ingredients[edit | edit source]\nName Ingredients\n[hide]\nSmelting recipe\nCopper Ingot Copper Ore or\nDeepslate Copper Ore or\nRaw Copper +\nAny fuel\n\n\n0.7\nSounds[edit | edit source]\nCopper ore[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition:\n[hide]\nv t e\nstone sound type\nSound Subtitles Source Description Resource location Translation key Volume Pitch Attenuation\ndistance\nBlock broken Blocks Once the block has broken block.stone.break subtitles.block.generic.break 1.0 0.8 16\nBlock placed Blocks When the block is placed block.stone.place subtitles.block.generic.place 1.0 0.8 16\nBlock breaking Blocks While the block is in the process of being broken block.stone.hit subtitles.block.generic.hit 0.25 0.5 16\nSomething falls on a block Entity-Dependent Falling on the block with fall damage block.stone.fall subtitles.block.generic.fall 0.5 0.75 16\nFootsteps Entity-Dependent Walking on the block block.stone.step subtitles.block.generic.footsteps 0.15 1.0 16\nBedrock Edition:\n[hide]\nv t e\nstone sound type\nSound Source Description Resource location Volume Pitch\nBlocks Once the block has broken dig.stone 1.0 0.8-1.0\nBlocks When the block is placed dig.stone 1.0 0.8-1.0\nBlocks While the block is in the process of being broken hit.stone 0.37 0.5\nPlayers Falling on the block with fall damage fall.stone 0.4 1.0\nPlayers Walking on the block step.stone 0.3 1.0\nBlocks Jumping from the block jump.stone 0.12 1.0\nBlocks Falling on the block without fall damage land.stone 0.22 1.0\nDeepslate copper ore[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition:\n[hide]\nv t e\ndeepslate sound type\nSound Subtitles Source Description Resource location Translation key Volume Pitch Attenuation\ndistance\nBlock broken Blocks Once the block has broken block.deepslate.break subtitles.block.generic.break 1.0 0.8 16\nBlock placed Blocks When the block is placed block.deepslate.place subtitles.block.generic.place 1.0 0.8 16\nBlock breaking Blocks While the block is in the process of being broken block.deepslate.hit subtitles.block.generic.hit 0.25 0.5 16\nSomething falls on a block Entity-Dependent Falling on the block with fall damage block.deepslate.fall subtitles.block.generic.fall 0.5 0.75 16\nFootsteps Entity-Dependent Walking on the block block.deepslate.step subtitles.block.generic.footsteps 0.15 1.0 16\nBedrock Edition:\n[hide]\nv t e\ndeepslate sound type\nSound Source Description Resource location Volume Pitch\nBlocks Once the block has broken dig.deepslate 1.0 0.8-1.0\nBlocks When the block is placed place.deepslate 1.0 0.8-1.0\nBlocks While the block is in the process of being broken hit.deepslate 0.3 0.5\nPlayers Falling on the block with fall damage fall.deepslate 0.4 1.0\nPlayers Walking on the block step.deepslate 0.3 1.0\nPlayers Jumping from the block jump.deepslate 0.12 1.0\nPlayers Falling on the block without fall damage land.deepslate 0.22 1.0\nData values[edit | edit source]\nID[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition:\nName Identifier Form Block tags\n[hide]\nTranslation key\nCopper Ore copper_ore Block & Item copper_ores\nmineable/pickaxe\nneeds_stone_tool\nsnaps_goat_horn\nblock.minecraft.copper_ore\nDeepslate Copper Ore deepslate_copper_ore Block & Item copper_ores\nmineable/pickaxe\nneeds_stone_tool\nblock.minecraft.deepslate_copper_ore\nBedrock Edition:\nName Identifier Numeric ID Form Item ID[i 1]\n[hide]\nTranslation key\nCopper Ore copper_ore 566 Block & Giveable Item[i 2] Identical[i 3]\ntile.copper_ore.name\nDeepslate Copper Ore deepslate_copper_ore 663 Block & Giveable Item[i 2] Identical[i 3]\ntile.deepslate_copper_ore.name\n↑ ID of block's direct item form, which is used in savegame files and addons.\n↑\na b Available with /give command.\n↑\na b The block's direct item form has the same ID as the block.\nVideo[edit | edit source]\nHistory[edit | edit source]\nOctober 3, 2020 Copper ore is announced at Minecraft Live 2020.\nFebruary 22, 2021 JAPPA shows updated copper ore texture.\n[hide]\nJava Edition\n1.17 20w45a Added copper ore.\nCopper ore generates evenly between levels 0 and 63, and has the same rarity as iron ore.\n21w06a The height limit was expanded down to Y=-64.

Because of this, the name of the Copper Spleaves is a combination of the words \"Spleef\" and \"Leaves\".[citation needed]\nThe exact y level the player needs to be in to not break the copper spleaves is just less than 1 above the block.\nCopper spleaves have only a weathered texture, despite being a copper block.\nIn 1.21 a similar block named \"copper grates\" has been added, having a similar appearance to copper spleaves.\nNavigation[edit | edit source]\n[hide]\nv t e\nCopper\nMaterial Ore Deepslate Ore Raw Raw Block Ingot\nBlock of Copper Unoxidized Waxed Exposed Waxed Weathered Waxed Oxidized Waxed\nChiseled Copper Unoxidized Waxed Exposed Waxed Weathered Waxed Oxidized Waxed\nCopper Grate Unoxidized Waxed Exposed Waxed Weathered Waxed Oxidized Waxed\nCut Copper Unoxidized Waxed Exposed Waxed Weathered Waxed Oxidized Waxed\nCut Copper Stairs Unoxidized Waxed Exposed Waxed Weathered Waxed Oxidized Waxed\nCut Copper Slab Unoxidized Waxed Exposed Waxed Weathered Waxed Oxidized Waxed\nCopper Door Unoxidized Waxed Exposed Waxed Weathered Waxed Oxidized Waxed\nCopper Trapdoor Unoxidized Waxed Exposed Waxed Weathered Waxed Oxidized Waxed\nCopper Bulb Unoxidized Waxed Exposed Waxed Weathered Waxed Oxidized Waxed\nMiscellaneous Brush Element Lightning Rod Spyglass Trial Chambers\nApril Fools' Day jokes Sink Filled Spleaves\nUnimplemented or Removed Button Golem Horn\n[hide]\nv t e\nBlocks\n[show]\nStructural\n[show]\nOrnamental\n[show]\nNatural\n[show]\nUtility\n[show]\nCreative or commands only\n[show]\nUnused\n[show]\nUnimplemented\n[hide]\nJoke features\nApril Fools 2013 Block of Coal Etho Slab Tinted Glass Torch (Burnt-out)\nApril Fools 2016 USB Charger Block\nApril Fools 2020 An Ant Box of Infinite Books Cursor Funky Portal Leftover Swaggiest stairs ever\nApril Fools 2022 How did we get here?\nApril Fools 2023 Cheese Copper Sink Filled Copper Spleaves Golden Chest Other Portal Packed Air Pickaxe Block Place Block\nApril Fools 2024 Baked Potato Bricks Expired Charred Big Brain Block of Amber Block of Potato Peels Corrupted Floatater Floatato Frying Table Gravtater Pedestal Peelgrass Block Corrupted Poison Farmland Poison Path Poisonous Mashed Potato Poisonous Potato Block Compressed Double Compressed Triple Compressed Quadruple Compressed Poisonous Potato Cutter Poisonous Potato Head Block Poisonous Potato Headpiece Poisonous Potato Ore Deepslate Potato Battery Potato Bud Potato flower Potato Fruit Potato Leaves Potato Pedicule Potato Portal Potato Refinery Potato Sprouts Potato Stem Planks Slab Stairs Door Trapdoor Button Pressure Plate Sign Hanging Sign Fence Fence Gate Potone Copper Ore Diamond Ore Gold Ore Iron Ore Lapis Lazuli Ore Redstone Ore Resin Ore Powerful Potato Strong Roots Taterstone Terre de Pomme Vicious Potato Weak Roots\n[show]\nRemoved\n[hide]\nv t e\nJoke features\n[show]\nBeta 1.4\n[show]\nMinecraft 2.0\n[show]\n15w14a\n[show]\n1.RV-Pre1\n[show]\n3D Shareware v1.34\n[show]\n20w14∞\n[show]\n22w13oneBlockAtATime\n[hide]\n23w13a_or_b\nBlocks Cheese Copper Sink Copper Spleaves Golden Chest Other Portal Packed Air Pickaxe Block Place Block\nItems Air Bit Bottle of Entity Splash Bottle of Void La Baguette Le Tricolore Longer String minecraft:dupe_hack Moon Cow Spawn Egg New Thing Banner Pattern Potion of Big Splash Lingering Arrow Potion of Small Splash Lingering Arrow Tag Name String End Unused Byte Short Int Long Float Double Compound List Left Square Right Square Left Curly Right Curly Sssyntax Error\nMobs Moon Cow Ray Tracing\nEffects Big Small\nWorld generation\nDimension The Moon\nStructures Lunar Base Other Portal\nBiomes The Moon\nCommands /transform /vote\n[show]\n24w14potato",

Copper trapdoors are also affected by the wind burst of thrown wind charges, causing them to open if closed, or vice versa.\nBarrier[edit | edit source]\nA copper trapdoor can be opened or closed by pressing the Use Item/Place Block control.\nRedstone component[edit | edit source]\nCopper trapdoors can be controlled with redstone power. When activated, the copper trapdoor immediately opens. When deactivated, it immediately closes.\nAn activated copper trapdoor can still be closed by a player, and does not re-open until it receives a new activation signal (if a trapdoor has been closed \"by hand\", it still needs to be deactivated and then reactivated to open by redstone).\nOxidation[edit | edit source]\nMain article: Oxidation\nNon-waxed copper trapdoors have four stages of oxidation (including the initial normal state). Lightning bolts can remove the oxidation on copper trapdoors. However, axes cannot be used in the same way they can with other copper blocks (because right clicking on non-waxed copper trapdoors while holding an axe only toggles the trapdoor). Instead, copper trapdoors must be right-clicked with an axe while crouching to deoxidize them. They can be waxed with honeycomb to prevent oxidation from progressing.\nAs the block begins to oxidize (exposed), it gets discolored and green spots begin to appear. As the oxidation continues (weathered), the block is a green color with brown spots. In the last stage (oxidized), the block is teal with several green spots.\nSounds[edit | edit source]\nGeneric[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition:\n[hide]\nv t e\ncopper sound type\nSound Subtitles

Several ways are shown where the\narrangement would cause coral blocks to stay alive\nor die.\nCoral blocks can be used for building or as decoration blocks.\nPlacement[edit | edit source]\nIn order for a coral block to stay alive, at least one of the six directly adjacent blocks must be water or a waterlogged block. If placed outside of water, it transforms into its respective dead coral block after 3 to 4.95 seconds‌[Java Edition only] or 2.25 seconds‌[Bedrock Edition only] — a grayscale version of the coral block. A coral block still dies if the game rule randomTickSpeed is set to 0.[1] Once a coral block dies, it is not possible to turn a dead coral block into a live coral block.\nIn Bedrock Edition, coral blocks do not die if they are surrounded by any non-air blocks.[2]\nSea pickle farm blocks[edit | edit source]\nIf sea pickles are planted on live coral blocks, using bone meal on the sea pickles increases the number of sea pickles and creates more sea pickles on nearby coral blocks. Specifically, they can spread to the original sea pickle's level or one level below, out to a horizontal taxicab distance of 2. This only works on living coral blocks, not dead coral blocks.\nNote Blocks[edit | edit source]\nAll types of coral blocks can be placed under note blocks to produce \"bass drum\" sounds.\nSounds[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition:\n[hide]\nv t e\ncoral_block sound type\nSound Subtitles Source Description Resource location Translation key Volume Pitch Attenuation\ndistance\nBlock broken Blocks Once the block has broken block.coral_block.break subtitles.block.generic.break 1.0 0.8 16\nBlock placed Blocks When the block is placed block.coral_block.place subtitles.block.generic.place 1.0 0.8 16\nBlock breaking Blocks While the block is in the process of being broken block.coral_block.hit subtitles.block.generic.hit 0.25 0.5 16\nSomething falls on a block Entity-Dependent Falling on the block with fall damage block.coral_block.fall subtitles.block.generic.fall 0.5 0.75 16\nFootsteps Entity-Dependent Walking on the block block.coral_block.step subtitles.block.generic.footsteps 0.15 1.5 16\nBedrock Edition:[sound 1]\n[hide]\nv t e\nstone sound type\nSound Source Description Resource location Volume Pitch\nBlocks Once the block has broken dig.stone 1.0 0.8-1.0\nBlocks When the block is placed dig.stone 1.0 0.8-1.0\nBlocks While the block is in the process of being broken hit.stone 0.37 0.5\nPlayers Falling on the block with fall damage fall.stone 0.4 1.0\nPlayers Walking on the block step.stone 0.3 1.0\nBlocks Jumping from the block jump.stone 0.12 1.0\nBlocks Falling on the block without fall damage land.stone 0.22 1.0\n↑ MCPE-76182 — Coral uses stone sounds\nData values[edit | edit source]\nID[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition:\nName Identifier Form Block tags\n[hide]\nTranslation key\nTube Coral Block tube_coral_block Block & Item coral_blocks\nmineable/pickaxe\nblock.minecraft.tube_coral_block\nBrain Coral Block brain_coral_block Block & Item coral_blocks\nmineable/pickaxe\nblock.minecraft.brain_coral_block\nBubble Coral Block bubble_coral_block Block & Item coral_blocks\nmineable/pickaxe\nblock.minecraft.bubble_coral_block\nFire Coral Block fire_coral_block Block & Item coral_blocks\nmineable/pickaxe\nblock.minecraft.fire_coral_block\nHorn Coral Block horn_coral_block Block & Item coral_blocks\nmineable/pickaxe\nblock.minecraft.horn_coral_block\nBedrock Edition:\nName Identifier Alias ID Numeric ID Form Item ID[i 1]\n[hide]\nTranslation key\nTube Coral Block tube_coral_block coral_block / 0 -132 Block & Giveable Item[i 2] Identical[i 3]\ntile.coral_block.blue.name\nBrain Coral Block brain_coral_block coral_block / 1 -849 Block & Giveable Item[i 2] Identical[i 3]\ntile.coral_block.pink.name\nBubble Coral Block bubble_coral_block coral_block / 2 -850 Block & Giveable Item[i 2] Identical[i 3]\ntile.coral_block.purple.name\nFire Coral Block fire_coral_block coral_block / 3 -851 Block & Giveable Item[i 2] Identical[i 3]\ntile.coral_block.red.name\nHorn Coral Block horn_coral_block coral_block / 4 -852 Block & Giveable Item[i 2] Identical[i 3]\ntile.coral_block.yellow.name\n↑ ID of block's direct item form, which is used in savegame files and addons.\n↑\na b c d e Available with /give command.\n↑\na b c d e The block's direct item form has the same ID as the block.\nHistory[edit | edit source]\nThis section is missing information about: when something about coral slabs not being added mentioned by a dev. \nPlease expand the section to include this information.

In Java Edition, they are also technically capable of growing in dripstone caves and deep dark biomes, though it is very unlikely due to lack of grass blocks in these biomes. In flower forests and meadows, cornflowers only generate as part of gradients.\nNatural cornflowers are also found in plains villages.\nPost-generation[edit | edit source]\nMain article: Flower § Post-generation\nJava Edition[edit | edit source]\nWhen bone meal is applied to a grass block in a plains, sunflower plains, flower forest, meadow, dripstone caves, or deep dark biome, cornflowers have a chance of generating on the targeted block and adjacent grass blocks in a 15×5×15 area. In meadows and flower forests, cornflowers can generate only in specific locations depending on the flower gradient. In plains, sunflower plains, dripstone caves, and the deep dark, cornflowers cannot generate in tulip-only areas.\nBedrock Edition[edit | edit source]\nWhen bone meal is applied to a grass block in a plains, sunflower plains, or flower forest biome, cornflowers have a chance of generating on the targeted block and adjacent grass blocks in a 7×5×7 area. In flower forests, cornflowers can generate only in specific locations depending on the flower gradient. In plains and sunflower plains, cornflowers cannot generate in tulip-only areas.\nWhen bone meal is applied to a cornflower that has been placed on top of a grass block in any biome, more cornflowers appear on top of nearby grass blocks. The flowers can appear up to 3 blocks away from the original, forming a 7×7 square.\nMob loot[edit | edit source]\nIn Java Edition, endermen can pick up cornflowers, like any other one-block-tall flower, and drop it if killed while holding it.\nTrading[edit | edit source]\nWandering traders may sell a cornflower for a single emerald.\nUsage[edit | edit source]\nMain article: Flower § Usage\nLike other flowers, cornflowers can be used as decoration and planted on grass blocks, dirt, coarse dirt, rooted dirt, farmland, podzol, mycelium, moss blocks, mud, or muddy mangrove roots.\nCornflowers can also be placed in flower pots.\nCrafting ingredient[edit | edit source]\nName Ingredients\n[hide]\nCrafting recipe\nBlue Dye Cornflower\n\nSuspicious Stew Red Mushroom +\nBrown Mushroom +\nBowl +\nCornflower\n\n\nSuspicious stew[edit | edit source]\nMain article: Suspicious Stew\nUsing a cornflower to make suspicious stew, whether by direct crafting or by feeding a brown mooshroom and then milking it with a bowl, imbues it with a Jump Boost effect that lasts 5 seconds.\nIngredients\n[hide]\nCrafting recipe\nRed Mushroom +\nBrown Mushroom +\nBowl +\nCornflower\n\n\nBees[edit | edit source]\nBees engage in a pollinating behavior with cornflowers, increasing the honey level in beehives and bee nests by 1.\nBreeding[edit | edit source]\nCornflowers can be used to breed, grow, and lead bees.\nBee nests[edit | edit source]\nOak, birch, and cherry trees grown from saplings that are within 2 blocks of a cornflower have a 5% chance to grow with a bee nest and 2-3 bees in it.\nComposting[edit | edit source]\nPlacing a cornflower into a composter has a 65% chance of raising the compost level by 1.

Additionally, using corrupted potato peels on terre de pomme turns it to corrupted peelgrass.\nUsage[edit | edit source]\nFarming[edit | edit source]\nUsing a hoe on a corrupted peelgrass block turns it into poison farmland. Potatoes can grow on corrupted peelgrass blocks without the need of tilling them.\nPaths[edit | edit source]\nUsing a shovel on a corrupted peelgrass block turns it into a poison path.\nPeeling[edit | edit source]\nUsing a potato peeler on a corrupted peelgrass block turns it into terre de pomme, and drops corrupted potato peels.\nSheep[edit | edit source]\nWhen a sheep eats a corrupted peelgrass block, the block turns into terre de pomme, and a sheared sheep regrows its wool.

Its inventory acts as a crafting table that crafts when it is powered, ejecting the crafted item (or items) from its \"mouth\" into the world or into a container it is facing. Its inventory slots can be individually locked to prevent hoppers, droppers, etc. from filling them; crafting recipes treat locked slots as empty of items.\nContents\n1 Obtaining\n1.1 Breaking\n1.2 Crafting\n2 Usage\n2.1 Container\n2.2 Redstone component\n3 Sounds\n3.1 Generic\n3.2 Unique\n4 Data values\n4.1 ID\n4.2 Block states\n4.3 Block data\n5 Achievements\n6 Advancements\n7 Video\n8 History\n9 Issues\n10 Gallery\n10.1 Mojang screenshots\n10.2 Screenshots\n10.3 Development images\n10.4 In other media\n10.5 Concept artwork\n11 References\n12 External links\n13 Navigation\nObtaining[edit | edit source]\nBreaking[edit | edit source]\nCrafters can be mined with anything, but pickaxes are the quickest.\nBlock Crafter\nHardness 1.5\nTool\nBreaking time (sec)[A]\nDefault 2.25\nWooden 1.15\nStone 0.6\nIron 0.4\nDiamond 0.3\nNetherite 0.25\nGolden 0.2\nOptions\nEfficiency\n0\nHaste\n0\nJE\nBE\nLegend\ndrops nothing\ndrops something other than the block itself\ndrops the block itself\nitalicized can be instant mined\n↑ These durations ignore other influential factors (e.g. Mining Fatigue), and are measured in seconds. For more information, see Breaking § Speed.\nCrafting[edit | edit source]\nIngredients\n[hide]\nCrafting recipe\nIron Ingot +\nCrafting Table +\nRedstone Dust +\nDropper\n\nUsage[edit | edit source]\nIn Java Edition, crafters cannot be moved by pistons.\nThe crafter's GUI in Java Edition.\nA simple contraption for crafting cake using the crafter\nContainer[edit | edit source]\nA crafter has nine slots of inventory space, arranged in a 3-by-3 grid like a crafting table. Its GUI can be accessed by using it.\nA slot can be enabled or disabled, which can be toggled by clicking on it when empty. Disabled slots cannot have items put in them.\nHoppers, droppers and other crafters interact with crafters by inserting items into its inventory; hoppers can remove ingredients as well. The added items are distributed from the top left to the bottom right of the enabled slots if there is an empty slot, if the crafter has all item slots filled then items are added to the lowest count item stack of the same type.[1] Hoppers and droppers can interact with all sides of the crafter, and prioritize filling empty spaces, followed by the smallest stack of the item.\nRedstone component[edit | edit source]\nWhen a crafter receives a redstone signal, it waits for 2 redstone ticks (4 game ticks, or 0.2 seconds barring lag) before ejecting one crafted item using the ingredients from the nine inventory slots. The crafted items are subsequently ejected from the front of the crafter. If the front of a crafter is facing a container (including another crafter), the crafted items are transferred into the container. If the container it is facing is full, or the item cannot be inserted into the container, the crafter ejects the item instead. Crafters interact with containers similar to droppers. If a recipe has byproducts (e.g. empty bottles for honey blocks or empty buckets for cake) those are ejected after the crafted item.\nFor shaped recipes, the position of the items in the inventory matters. Because disabled slots prevent items from entering the slot, crafters can be used to craft any item in the game automatically without any input from the player, using a series of hoppers and/or droppers and the correct configuration of disabled slots for the recipe.\nA hopper placed below a crafter collects the ingredients from the crafting grid, not the resulting item.\nIn Java Edition, unlike dispensers and droppers, crafters aren't affected by quasi-connectivity.[2]\nComparators can emit a redstone signal when reading from a crafter. The signal strength is equal to the number of crafting slots that are either disabled or occupied by an item. [3] The stack size of the item has no effect on the comparators output signal e.g. having 1 stick in a slot vs having 64 sticks in that same slot both output the same comparator signal. An empty crafter with no disabled slots does not output any signal through a comparator. A crafter with every slot being disabled or containing an item (of any stack size) outputs a signal strength of nine through a comparator.\nSounds[edit | edit source]\nGeneric[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition:\n[hide]\nv t e\nstone sound type\nSound Subtitles Source Description Resource location Translation key Volume Pitch Attenuation\ndistance\nBlock broken Blocks Once the block has broken block.stone.break subtitles.block.generic.break 1.0 0.8 16\nBlock placed Blocks When the block is placed block.stone.place subtitles.block.generic.place 1.0 0.8 16\nBlock breaking Blocks While the block is in the process of being broken block.stone.hit subtitles.block.generic.hit 0.25 0.5 16\nSomething falls on a block Entity-Dependent Falling on the block with fall damage block.stone.fall subtitles.block.generic.fall 0.5 0.75 16\nFootsteps Entity-Dependent Walking on the block block.stone.step subtitles.block.generic.footsteps 0.15 1.0 16\nBedrock Edition:\n[hide]\nv t e\nstone sound type\nSound Source Description Resource location Volume Pitch\nBlocks Once the block has broken dig.stone 1.0 0.8-1.0\nBlocks When the block is placed dig.stone 1.0 0.8-1.0\nBlocks While the block is in the process of being broken hit.stone 0.37 0.5\nPlayers Falling on the block with fall damage fall.stone 0.4 1.0\nPlayers Walking on the block step.stone 0.3 1.0\nBlocks Jumping from the block jump.stone 0.12 1.0\nBlocks Falling on the block without fall damage land.stone 0.22 1.0\nUnique[edit | edit source]\nThis section is missing information about: sound when clicking on slots for enabling and disabling. \nPlease expand the section to include this information.

Using this method does not require any experience, but removes any enchantments (like a grindstone) on either or both items except curse enchantments.

Pale oaks grown from their saplings do not generate with hearts.\nCrafting[edit | edit source]\nIngredients\n[hide]\nCrafting recipe\nPale Oak Log +\nBlock of Resin\n\nUsage[edit | edit source]\nA creaking heart can be placed in different orientations, similar to logs. It has two states: disabled and active. The creaking heart is disabled by default, but when properly aligned between two pale oak logs, or any variants of pale oak logs, it becomes active. When a creaking heart becomes active, its texture changes and it appears to be illuminated; although, it does not actually produce light. Removing one of these blocks reverts the heart to disabled if it hasn't already spawned a creaking.\nCreaking hearts generate resin clumps on nearby pale oak logs when its linked creaking is attacked by a player. There is a brief cooldown between each resin clump generation.\nSpawning mechanics[edit | edit source]\nMain article: Creaking § Spawning\nA disabled creaking heart (left) and an active creaking heart (right)\nCreaking hearts are active during the same times players can sleep, at night (at 12542 ticks in clear weather, when stars appear in the sky, or 12010 ticks in rainy weather) or during a thunderstorm. If an active creaking heart is in the Overworld, it waits 2 ticks (0.1 seconds) and checks if the matching logs are in place. If so and it detects no linked creaking, it tries to find a valid location in a 33×17×33 box centered at that creaking heart to spawn one until successful, interrupted by getting destroyed or disabled. If found, it waits 20 ticks (1 second) before checking again if the matching logs are in place. If successful, it spawns a creaking after 2 extra ticks, otherwise it disables. While a creaking heart is active and has a linked creaking, it does not deactivate until broken, even if any of the matching blocks are removed.\nCreaking hearts do not function outside the simulation distance of players.\nValid locations for creakings to spawn at follow these criteria:\nThe block below must have a solid top surface.\nThe block below is not leaves.\nThe location is any non-solid block. This means blocks like carpet can spawn-proof creakings, but not buttons.\nThe location is where there would be no liquid or other entities' hitboxes within a creaking's hitbox.\nCreakings ignore solid blocks within its hitbox that are 2+ blocks above the ground while spawning.\nCreaking hearts never spawn creakings in the Nether nor the End.\nDespawning creakings[edit | edit source]\nBreaking the heart kills its linked creaking and attributes the kill to the player who broke it, adding the kill to their statistics and triggering the Monster Hunter and Monsters Hunted advancements.\nDuring daytime (at 23460 ticks in clear weather, or at 23992 ticks in rainy weather), creaking hearts despawn their linked creakings.\nIf the heart's linked creaking is too far away, that creaking despawns, and the heart spawns another one if conditions are met.\nRedstone component[edit | edit source]\nA redstone comparator connected to a creaking heart outputs a signal if the heart has a linked creaking. The strength of the signal depends on the Euclidean distance between the heart and its creaking, and is calculated as follows:\noutput\n=\n1\n5\n−\n⌊\ndistance\n3\n2\n×\n1\n5\n⌋\nPistons of any kind cannot move creaking hearts.\nAmbient sounds[edit | edit source]\nA creaking heart emits subtle eerie sounds when it is active and surrounded by any types of logs, stripped logs, wood, or stripped wood in all 6 directions.\nSounds[edit | edit source]\nGeneric[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition:\n[hide]\nv t e\ncreaking_heart sound type\nSound Subtitles Source Description Resource location Translation key Volume Pitch Attenuation\ndistance\nBlock broken Blocks Once the block has broken block.creaking_heart.break subtitles.block.generic.break 0.5 0.8 16\nBlock placed Blocks When the block is placed block.creaking_heart.place subtitles.block.generic.place 1.0 0.8 16\nBlock breaking Blocks While the block is in the process of being broken block.creaking_heart.hit subtitles.block.generic.hit 0.25 0.5 16\nSomething falls on a block Entity-Dependent Falling on the block with fall damage block.creaking_heart.fall subtitles.block.generic.fall 0.5 0.75 16\nFootsteps Entity-Dependent Walking on the block block.creaking_heart.step subtitles.block.generic.footsteps 0.15 1.0 16\nBedrock Edition:\n[hide]\nv t e\ncreaking_heart sound type\nSound Source Description Resource location Volume Pitch\nBlocks Once the block has broken block.creaking_heart.break 0.5 0.8\nBlocks When the block is placed block.creaking_heart.place 0.7 0.8\nBlocks While the block is in the process of being broken block.creaking_heart.hit 0.25 0.5\nPlayers Falling on the block with fall damage block.creaking_heart.fall 0.5 0.75\nPlayers Walking on the block block.creaking_heart.step 0.15 1.0\nPlayers Jumping from the block block.creaking_heart.step 0.12 1.1\nPlayers Falling on the block without fall damage block.creaking_heart.step 0.4 1.0\nUnique[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition:\n[hide]\nSounds\nSound Subtitles Source Description Resource location Translation key Volume Pitch Attenuation\ndistance\nCreaking Heart grumbles Blocks When a creaking heart's creaking is attacked by a player block.creaking_heart.hurt subtitles.block.creaking_heart.hurt Varies[sound 1] 1.0 16\nCreaking manifests Hostile Creatures When a creaking heart summons a creaking entity.creaking.spawn subtitles.entity.creaking.spawn 1.0 0.8-1.2 16\nCreaking Heart awakens Blocks When a creaking heart summons a creaking block.creaking_heart.spawn subtitles.block.creaking_heart.spawn 1.0 1.0 16\nEerie noise Blocks Randomly while active[sound 2] block.creaking_heart.idle subtitles.block.creaking_heart.idle 1.0 1.0 16\n↑ Plays ten times with an interval of 10 ticks starting at 1 and linearly interpolating to 0.55.

Crimson fungi grow into huge crimson fungi, respectively. The stem, shroomlight, or wart blocks may replace certain blocks including slabs and torches.\nBreeding[edit | edit source]\nCrimson fungus can be used to breed hoglins and keep them from despawning, but feeding hoglins does not stop them from attacking the player.\nComposting[edit | edit source]\nPlacing a crimson fungus into a composter has a 65% chance of raising the compost level by 1.\nSounds[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition:\n[hide]\nv t e\nfungus sound type\nSound Subtitles Source Description Resource location Translation key Volume Pitch Attenuation\ndistance\nBlock broken Blocks Once the block has broken block.fungus.break subtitles.block.generic.break 1.0 0.8 16\nBlock placed Blocks When the block is placed block.fungus.place subtitles.block.generic.place 1.0 0.8 16\nNone Block breaking Blocks While the block is in the process of being broken block.fungus.hit subtitles.block.generic.hit 0.25 0.5 16\nSomething falls on a block Entity-Dependent Falling on the block with fall damage block.fungus.fall subtitles.block.generic.fall 0.5 0.75 16\nFootsteps Entity-Dependent Walking on the block block.fungus.step subtitles.block.generic.footsteps 0.135 0.9/1.12 16\nBedrock Edition:\n[hide]\nv t e\nfungus sound type\nSound Source Description Resource location Volume Pitch\nBlocks Once the block has broken dig.fungus 1.0 0.8-1.0\nBlocks When the block is placed dig.fungus 1.0 0.8-1.0\nBlocks While the block is in the process of being broken dig.fungus 0.25 0.5\nBlocks Falling on the block with fall damage dig.fungus 0.4 1.0\nBlocks Walking on the block dig.fungus 0.15 1.0\nBlocks Jumping from the block dig.fungus 0.12 1.0\nBlocks Falling on the block without fall damage dig.fungus 0.14 1.0\nData values[edit | edit source]\nID[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition:\nName Identifier Form Block tags\n[hide]\nTranslation key\nCrimson Fungus crimson_fungus Block & Item enderman_holdable\nblock.minecraft.crimson_fungus\nBedrock Edition:\nName Identifier Numeric ID Form Item ID[i 1]\n[hide]\nTranslation key\nCrimson Fungus crimson_fungus 483 Block & Giveable Item[i 2] Identical[i 3]\ntile.crimson_fungus.name\n↑ ID of block's direct item form, which is used in savegame files and addons.\n↑ Available with /give command.\n↑ The block's direct item form has the same ID as the block.\nHistory[edit | edit source]\n[hide]\nJava Edition\nSeptember 28, 2019 Crimson fungus was shown as part of crimson forest biome.\n1.16 20w06a Added crimson fungi.\n20w07a Crimson fungi can now be obtained by bartering with piglins, making them renewable.

Air must be above the netherrack during this process. This transformation can also be done by activating a dispenser with bone meal directly into that netherrack block. If both types of nylium are present, there is an equal chance of either being spread.\nRenewability[edit | edit source]\nThis feature is exclusive to Bedrock Edition. \nAs netherrack generates in nether portals spawn floating, using bone meal on netherrack turns them into nylium, making them renewable.\nUsage[edit | edit source]\nSimilar to grass blocks and mycelium, crimson nylium decays (based on random ticks) into netherrack when an opaque block is placed above it. However, unlike grass blocks and mycelium, it does not decay underneath water or lava.[1] It decays when covered with snow.[2]\nLike mycelium and podzol, mushrooms can remain on nylium blocks in any light level. Huge mushrooms can be grown by using bone meal on mushrooms planted on nylium.\nCrimson Fungi can likewise be grown into huge crimson fungi using bone meal, although the fungus must be placed on the same type of nylium, or the bone meal is never consumed.\nSimilar to grass blocks, the player can apply bone meal to crimson nylium. This nylium, along with nearby nylium, generates vegetation that occurs in its native biome (crimson nylium generates mostly crimson forest vegetation and warped nylium generates mostly warped forest vegetation), and just like in the native biomes, the opposite type of fungi occassionally generates. The vegetation is generated in a 5×5 area, centered on the nylium block on which bone meal is used.\nNote Blocks[edit | edit source]\nCrimson nylium can be placed under note blocks to produce \"bass drum\" sounds.\nSounds[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition:\n[hide]\nv t e\nnylium sound type\nSound Subtitles Source Description Resource location Translation key Volume Pitch Attenuation\ndistance\nBlock broken Blocks Once the block has broken block.nylium.break subtitles.block.generic.break 0.85 0.8 16\nBlock placed Blocks When the block is placed block.nylium.place subtitles.block.generic.place 0.85 0.8 16\nBlock breaking Blocks While the block is in the process of being broken block.nylium.hit subtitles.block.generic.hit 0.25 0.5 16\nSomething falls on a block Entity-Dependent Falling on the block with fall damage block.nylium.fall subtitles.block.generic.fall 0.5 0.75 16\nFootsteps Entity-Dependent Walking on the block block.nylium.step subtitles.block.generic.footsteps 0.15 1.0 16\nBedrock Edition:\n[hide]\nv t e\nnylium sound type\nSound Source Description Resource location Volume Pitch\nBlocks Once the block has broken dig.nylium 1.0 0.8-1.0\nBlocks When the block is placed dig.nylium 1.0 0.8\nBlocks While the block is in the process of being broken hit.nylium 0.23 0.5\nPlayers Falling on the block with fall damage fall.nylium 0.4 1.0\nPlayers Walking on the block step.nylium 0.15 1.0\nBlocks Jumping from the block jump.nylium 0.12 1.0\nBlocks Falling on the block without fall damage land.nylium 0.14 1.0\nData values[edit | edit source]\nID[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition:\nName Identifier Block tags\n[hide]\nTranslation key\nCrimson Nylium crimson_nylium enderman_holdable\nmushroom_grow_block\nnylium\nmineable/pickaxe\nblock.minecraft.crimson_nylium\nBedrock Edition:\nName Identifier Numeric ID Form Item ID[i 1]\n[hide]\nTranslation key\nCrimson Nylium crimson_nylium 487 Block & Giveable Item[i 2] Identical[i 3]\ntile.crimson_nylium.name\n↑ ID of block's direct item form, which is used in savegame files and addons.\n↑ Available with /give command.\n↑ The block's direct item form has the same ID as the block.\nHistory[edit | edit source]\n[hide]\nJava Edition\nSeptember 28, 2019 Crimson nylium is announced at MINECON Live 2019.\nThen they use a planks sound.\n1.16 20w06a Added crimson nylium.\n20w12a Crimson nylium can now be fertilized with bone meal to grow crimson roots, warped roots, fungi and nether sprouts.\n20w16a Crimson nylium now generates in chests within bastion remnants.\n20w22a Crimson nylium now drops netherrack, unless broken with Silk Touch, in which case it drops itself.\n1.16.2 20w27a Mushrooms can now be placed and grown on crimson nylium at any light level.\n[hide]\nBedrock Edition\n1.16.0 beta 1.16.0.51 Added crimson nylium.\nCrimson nylium can be fertilized with bone meal to grow crimson roots, warped roots, and fungi.\nbeta 1.16.0.57 Crimson nylium now generates in chests within bastion remnants.\nIssues[edit | edit source]\nIssues relating to \"Crimson Nylium\" are maintained on the bug tracker.

When beds were added, they took this role instead. In 1.16 the respawn anchor was added which is crafted with crying obsidian.\nAccording to Brandon Pearce, crying obsidian was added when they wanted to have cracked obsidian for the ruined nether portals. They decided to add it as crying obsidian instead because it was more unique and due to high player demand.[citation needed]\nThe team considered having crying obsidian be obtained by throwing obsidian through a nether portal, or by having regular obsidian be struck by lightning. However, they chose bartering with piglins as a way to make bartering useful.[7]\nGallery[edit | edit source]\nA comparison between glowing obsidian (left), crying obsidian (middle), and regular obsidian (right)\nA bunch of crying obsidian placed in the Nether.\nObsidian and crying obsidian, as they appear in the Programmer Art resource pack.

Lightning bolts and axes can remove the oxidation on cut copper stairs. They can be waxed with a honeycomb to prevent it from oxidizing.\nAs the block begins to oxidize (exposed), it gets discolored and green spots begin to appear. As the oxidation continues (weathered), the block is a green color with brown spots. In the last stage (oxidized), the block is teal with several green spots.\nSounds[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition:\n[hide]\nv t e\ncopper sound type\nSound Subtitles Source Description Resource

As a result, dandelions can generate only in edge cases or custom worlds.\nBeach\nSnowy Beach\nStony Shore\nOcean\nDeep Ocean\nCold Ocean\nDeep Cold Ocean\nFrozen Ocean\nDeep Frozen Ocean\nLukewarm Ocean\nDeep Lukewarm Ocean\nWarm Ocean\nDesert\nIce Spikes\nDripstone Caves\nDeep Dark\nLush Caves‌[Bedrock Edition only]\nGrove‌[Bedrock Edition only]\nSnowy Slopes‌[Bedrock Edition only]\nStony Peaks‌[Bedrock Edition only]\nJagged Peaks‌[Bedrock Edition only]\nFrozen Peaks‌[Bedrock Edition only]\nIn jungles, bamboo jungles, sparse jungles, savannas and savanna plateaus, dandelions are twice as common as in other biomes. In flower forests and meadows, dandelions only generate as part of gradients.\nNatural dandelions are found in plains and savanna villages. Potted dandelions can also generate in woodland mansions.\nPost-generation[edit | edit source]\nMain article: Flower § Post-generation\nJava Edition[edit | edit source]\nWhen bone meal is applied to a grass block in one of the biomes listed above (except those marked as ‌[Bedrock Edition only]), dandelions have a chance of generating on the targeted block and adjacent grass blocks in a 15×5×15 area. In meadows and flower forests, dandelions can generate only in specific locations depending on the flower gradient. In plains, sunflower plains, dripstone caves, and the deep dark, dandelions cannot generate in tulip-only areas.\nBedrock Edition[edit | edit source]\nWhen bone meal is applied to a grass block in any biome except swamp, pale garden, and flower forest, dandelions have a chance of generating on the targeted block and adjacent grass blocks in a 7×5×7 area. Unlike Java Edition, bone meal can generate dandelions anywhere within a meadow biome. In plains and sunflower plains, dandelions cannot generate in tulip-only areas.\nWhen bone meal is applied to a dandelion in any biome, more dandelions appear on top of nearby grass blocks. Poppies can also occasionally appear, and dandelions can occasionally appear when bone meal is applied to poppies. The flowers can appear up to 3 blocks away from the original, forming a 7×7 square.\nMob loot[edit | edit source]\nEndermen can pick up dandelions, like any other one-block-tall flower, and drop it if killed while holding it.\nGenerated loot[edit | edit source]\nItem Structure Container Quantity\n[hide]\nChance\nJava Edition and Bedrock Edition\nDandelion Village Plains house chest 1 22.8%\nTrading[edit | edit source]\nWandering traders may sell a dandelion for a single emerald.\nUsage[edit | edit source]\nMain article: Flower § Usage\nLike other flowers, dandelions can be used as decoration and planted on grass blocks, dirt, coarse dirt, rooted dirt, farmland, podzol, mycelium, moss blocks, mud, or muddy mangrove roots.\nDandelions can also be placed in flower pots.\nCrafting ingredient[edit | edit source]\nName Ingredients\n[hide]\nCrafting recipe\nSuspicious Stew Red Mushroom +\nBrown Mushroom +\nBowl +\nDandelion\n\n\nYellow Dye Dandelion\n\nSuspicious stew[edit | edit source]\nMain article: Suspicious Stew\nUsing a dandelion to make suspicious stew, whether by direct crafting or by feeding a brown mooshroom and then milking it with a bowl, imbues it with a Saturation effect that lasts 0.35 seconds in Java Edition and 0.3 seconds in Bedrock Edition.

Daylight detectors can be moved by pistons.‌[Bedrock Edition only] Water and lava flow around daylight detectors without affecting them.\nPlacement\nTo place a daylight detector, use the \"Use Item/Place Block\" control.\nA daylight detector can be \"inverted\", which reverses the power levels produced by the daylight detector. To invert a daylight detector, aim at the placed daylight detector and use the \"Use Item/Place Block\" control.\nActivation\nA daylight detector activates when exposed to sufficient daylight (daylight detector mode) or when exposure to daylight is low enough (inverted daylight detector mode).\nSources of block light (torches, glowstone, etc.) cannot activate a daylight detector.\nBehavior\nAn active daylight detector:\npowers adjacent redstone dust, including below it, and redstone comparators facing away from the daylight detector, to a power level that depends on the time of day, the weather, and the internal sky light level (see tables below)\npowers adjacent redstone repeaters facing away from the daylight detector to power level 15\nactivates adjacent redstone mechanisms, including above and below, such as pistons, redstone lamps, etc.\nA daylight detector has no effect on other adjacent blocks (for example, it cannot power a block the way a repeater can).\nThe output signal of daylight detectors in the loaded chunk is updated every 20 gametime‌[JE only]/daytime‌[BE only]. Block updates have no effect on daylight detectors.\nDaylight detector[edit | edit source]\nThe daylight detector power level depends on the time of day, the weather, and the internal sky light level.\nDaylight detector power levels when sky light level is 15\nPower Clear Rain or snowfall Thunder\nTime ↓ Time ↑ Time ↓ Time ↑ Time ↓ Time ↑\n0 13,670–(Midnight/18,000)-22,330\n(8,660 Gtk/7:13)\n13,670-(Midnight/18,000)–22,330\n(8,660 Gtk/7:13)\n13,670-(Midnight/18,000)–22,330\n(8,660 Gtk/7:13)\n1 22,331–22,781\n(450 Gtk/22.5 sec)\n13,219–13,669\n(450 Gtk/22.5 sec)\n22,331–22,798\n(467 Gtk/23.35 sec)\n13,203–13,669\n(466 Gtk/23.3 sec)\n22,331–22,943\n(612 Gtk/30.6 sec)\n13,058–13,669\n(611 Gtk/30.55 sec)\n2 22,782–23,069‌[JE only]/23,070‌[BE only]\nJ: (287 Gtk/14.35 sec) B: (288 Gtk/14.4 sec)\n12,931–13,218\n(287 Gtk/14.35 sec)\n22,799–23,231\n(432 Gtk/21.6 sec)\n12,769‌[JE only]/12,770‌[BE only]-13,202\nJ: (433 Gtk/21.65 sec) B: (432 Gtk/21.6 sec)\n22,944–23,352\n(408 Gtk/20.4 sec)\n12,648–13,057\n(409 Gtk/20.45 sec)\n3 23,070‌[JE only]/23,071‌[BE only]-23,296\nJ: (226 Gtk/11.3 sec) B: (225 Gtk/11.25 sec)\n12,705–12,930\n(225 Gtk/11.25 sec)\n23,232–23,504\n(272 Gtk/13.6 sec)\n12,497–12,768‌[JE only]/12,769‌[BE only]\nJ: (271 Gtk/13.55 sec) B: (272 Gtk/13.6 sec)\n23,353–23,700\n(347 Gtk/17.35 sec)\n12,300–12,647\n(347 Gtk/17.35 sec)\n4 23,297–23,529\n(232 Gtk/11.6 sec)\n12,471–12,704\n(233 Gtk/11.65 sec)\n23,505–23,745\n(240 Gtk/12 sec)\n12,256–12,496\n(240 Gtk/12 sec)\n23,701-(Dawn/24,000/0)–59\n(240 Gtk/12 sec)\n11,941‌[JE only]/11,942‌[BE only]-(Dusk/12,000)-12,299\nJ: (358 Gtk/17.9 sec) B: (357 Gtk/17.85 sec)\n5 23,530–23,767\n(237 Gtk/11.85 sec)\n12,233–12,470\n(237 Gtk/11.85 sec)\n23,746–23,991\n(245 Gtk/12.25 sec)\n12,010–12,255\n(245 Gtk/12.25 sec)\n60–441\n(381 Gtk/19.05 sec)\n11,560–11,940‌[JE only]/11,941‌[BE only]\nJ:(380 Gtk/19 sec) B: (381 Gtk/19.05 sec)\n6 23,768–23,960\n(192 Gtk/9.6 sec)\n12,041–12,232\n(191 Gtk/9.55 sec)\n23,992–(Dawn/24,000/0)-394\n(386 Gtk/19.3 sec)\n11,607–(Dusk/12,000)-12,009\n(402 Gtk/20.1 sec)\n442–1,039\n(597 Gtk/29.85 sec)\n10,962–11,559\n(597 Gtk/29.85 sec)\n7 23,961–(Dawn/24,000/0)-166\n(127 Gtk/6.35 sec)\n11,835–(Dusk/12,000)-12,040 (205 Gtk/10.25 sec) 395–882\n(487 Gtk/24.35 sec)\n11,119–11,606\n(487 Gtk/24.35 sec)\n1,040–1,735\n(695 Gtk/34.75 sec)\n10,266–10,961\n(695 Gtk/34.75 sec)\n8 167–535\n(368/18.4 sec)\n11,465‌[JE only]/11,466‌[BE only]-11,834\nJ: (369 Gtk/18.45 sec) B: (368 Gtk/18.4 sec)\n883–1,429‌[JE only]/1,430‌[BE only]\nJ: (546 Gtk/27.3 sec) B: (547 Gtk/27.35 sec)\n10,571–11,118\n(547 Gtk/27.35 sec)\n1,736–2,608\n(872 Gtk/43.6 sec)\n9,392–10,265\n(873 Gtk/43.65 sec)\n9 536–933\n(397 Gtk/19.85 sec)\n11,067–11,464‌[JE only]/11,465‌[BE only]\nJ: (397 Gtk/19.85 sec) B: (398 Gtk/19.9 sec)\n1,430‌[JE only]/1,431‌[BE only]-2,069\nJ: (639 Gtk/31.95 sec) B: (638 Gtk/31.6 sec)\n9,931–10,570\n(639 Gtk/31.95 sec)\n2,609–3,942\n(1,333 Gtk/1:06.65 sec)\n8,059–9,391\n(1,332 Gtk/1:06.6 sec)\n10 934–1,371\n(437 Gtk/21.85 sec)\n10,629–11,066\n(737 Gtk/36.85 sec)\n2,070–2,875\n(805 Gtk/40.25 sec)\n9,125‌[JE only]/9,126‌[BE only]-9,930\nJ: (805 Gtk/40.25 sec) B: (804 Gtk/40.2 sec)\n3,943–(Noon/6,000)-8,058\n(4115 Gtk/3:25)\n11 1,372–1,865\n(493 Gtk/24.65 sec)\n10,136–10,628\n(492 Gtk/24.6 sec)\n2,876–4,108\n(1,232 Gtk/1:01.6)\n7,892–9,124‌[JE only]/7,893–9,125‌[BE only]\nJ: (1,232 Gtk/1:01.6) B: (1,232 Gtk/1:01.6)\nN/A N/A\n12 1,866–2,444\n(578 Gtk/28.9 sec)\n9,557–10,135\n(578 Gtk/28.9 sec)\n4,109–(Noon/6,000)-7,891‌[JE only]/7,892‌[BE only]\nJ:(3,410 Gtk/2:50) B: (3,783 Gtk/3:9.15)\nN/A N/A\n13 2,445–3,175\n(730 Gtk/36.5 sec)\n8,826–9,556\n(730 Gtk/36.5 sec)\nN/A N/A N/A N/A\n14 3,176–4,294\n(1,118 Gtk/55.9 sec)\n7,706–8,825\n(1,119 Gtk/55.95 sec)\nN/A N/A N/A N/A\n15 4,295–(Noon/6,000)-7,705\n(3,410 Gtk/2:50)\nN/A N/A N/A N/A\nInverted daylight detector[edit | edit source]\nUsing a daylight detector inverts it. However, the output of the inverted detector is not a simple inversion of the daylight detector's output; it uses a much simpler algorithm that depends only on the internal sky light level. Specifically, it outputs a signal strength of 15 minus the current internal sky light level, where values over 15 or below 0 are taken as 15 or 0 respectively. This means that an inverted daylight detector actually outputs a strength of 11 at midnight when it's clear weather, if it has line of sight with the sky. The effects of shade are applied before inverting, so shade increases the signal strength when it isn't already full, and prevents it from reaching zero.\nFuel[edit | edit source]\nDaylight detectors can be used as a fuel in furnaces, smelting 1.5 items per block.\nNote blocks[edit | edit source]\nDaylight detectors can be placed under note blocks to produce \"bass\" sounds.\nSounds[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition:\n[hide]\nv t e\nwood sound type\nSound Subtitles Source Description Resource location Translation key Volume Pitch Attenuation\ndistance\nBlock broken Blocks Once the block has broken block.wood.break subtitles.block.generic.break 1.0 0.8 16\nBlock placed Blocks When the block is placed block.wood.place subtitles.block.generic.place 1.0 0.8 16\nBlock breaking Blocks While the block is in the process of being broken block.wood.hit subtitles.block.generic.hit 0.25 0.5 16\nSomething falls on a block Entity-Dependent Falling on the block with fall damage block.wood.fall subtitles.block.generic.fall 0.5 0.75 16\nFootsteps Entity-Dependent Walking on the block block.wood.step subtitles.block.generic.footsteps 0.15 1.0 16\nBedrock Edition:\n[hide]\nv t e\nwood sound type\nSound Source Description Resource location Volume Pitch\nBlocks Once the block has broken dig.wood 1.0 0.8-1.0\nBlocks When the block is placed dig.wood 1.0 0.8\nBlocks While the block is in the process of being broken hit.wood 0.23 0.5\nPlayers Falling on the block with fall damage fall.wood 0.4 1.0\nPlayers Walking on the block step.wood 0.3 1.0\nBlocks Jumping from the block jump.wood 0.12 1.0\nBlocks Falling on the block without fall damage land.wood 0.18 1.0\nData values[edit | edit source]\nID[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition:\nName Identifier Form\n[hide]\nTranslation key\nDaylight Detector daylight_detector Block & Item\nblock.minecraft.daylight_detector\nName\n[hide]\nIdentifier\nBlock entity daylight_detector\nBedrock Edition:\nName Identifier Numeric ID Form Item ID[i 1]\n[hide]\nTranslation key\nDaylight Detector daylight_detector 151 Block & Giveable Item[i 2] Identical[i 3]\ntile.daylight_detector.name\nInverted Daylight Detector daylight_detector_inverted 178 Block & Ungiveable Item[i 4] Identical[i 3]\ntile.daylight_detector_inverted.name\n↑ ID of block's direct item form, which is used in savegame files and addons.\n↑ Available with /give command.\n↑\na b The block's direct item form has the same ID as the block.\n↑ Unavailable with /give command\nName\n[hide]\nSavegame ID\nBlock entity DaylightDetector\nBlock states[edit | edit source]\nSee also: Block states\nJava Edition:\nName Default value Allowed values\n[hide]\nDescription\ninverted false false\ntrue If true, the daylight detector is inverted.\npower 0 0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15 The current redstone power level produced by the daylight sensor.\nBedrock Edition:\nName Metadata Bits Default value Allowed values Values for\nMetadata Bits\n[hide]\nDescription\nredstone_signal 0x1\n0x2\n0x4\n0x8 0 0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15 0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15 The current redstone power level produced by the daylight sensor.\n\nBlock data[edit | edit source]\nA daylight detector has a block entity associated with it which stores only its entity ID and position (the minimum data for a block entity).

A decorated pot drops the four pottery sherds or bricks used to craft it when mined with a pickaxe, axe, shovel, hoe or sword not enchanted with Silk Touch. It drops itself when mined with anything else, including tools listed above enchanted with Silk Touch. In either case, the tool does not lose durability.\nBlock Decorated Pot\nHardness 0\nBreaking time (secs)\nDefault 0.05\nOptions\nEfficiency\n0\nHaste\n0\nJE\nBE\nLegend\ndrops nothing\ndrops something other than the block itself\ndrops the block itself\nitalicized can be instant mined\nA decorated pot breaks when hit by one of the following projectiles, causing it to shatter into sherds or bricks:\nArrow\nTipped Arrow\nSpectral Arrow\nTrident\nFirework Rocket\nSnowball\nEgg\nFireball\nSmall Fireball\nDragon Fireball\nWither Skull\nWind Charge\nA decorated pot also shatters if a player collides with it while flying using elytra boosted by a firework rocket.\nA decorated pot drops itself if pushed by a piston. It also always drops itself when destroyed by an explosion, similar to other precious blocks such as beacons and shulker boxes.[1]\nStored items are dropped when the decorated pot is broken, regardless of whether the pot shatters into sherds or drops itself. Breaking a pot is the only way to access the stored items without using a hopper.\nIn Java Edition, if the cracked block state is set to true, a decorated pot always drops sherds or bricks regardless of the breaking method.\nCrafting[edit | edit source]\nIngredients Crafting recipe\n[hide]\nDescription\nAny Pottery Sherd or Brick\n\nIt is possible to use any combination of bricks and pottery sherds.\nThe decorated pot's side textures correspond to the item used in the crafting. If a pottery sherd is used, that side bears the texture of that pottery sherd, if a brick is used, that side bears the default texture.\nNatural generation[edit | edit source]\nDecorated pots naturally generate in trial chambers, with loot inside. Decorated pots in the trial chambers are composed of either four bricks or three bricks and either one flow, guster, or scrape pottery sherd.\nUsage[edit | edit source]\nDecorated pots can be used for decoration. Due to the top part of the decorated pot having no collision, other blocks can be placed on top of them, including other decorated pots and regular flower pots, which are required to place a flower in the decorated pot.\nPressing the use control on a decorated pot causes it to play a wobble animation, triggering a vibration frequency of 11.\nDecorated pots crafted without sherds can also serve as a temporary building block, similar to scaffolding and slime blocks, because they are easy to craft, stack to 64, and can be broken instantly by hand.\nStorage[edit | edit source]\nA decorated pot can store up to a stack of a single type of item. However, it will fill instantly if an item unstackable like a sword, a filled bucket or potions are stored in it. Unlike other containers, decorated pots have no GUI; items are inserted by interacting with the pot or by using droppers or hoppers. The only way to retrieve stored items is by breaking the pot or by using hoppers and minecarts with hopper.\nDecorated pots crafted without sherds can also serve as compact storage for bricks, as they are stackable, each can be crafted from four bricks and can be broken down into four bricks.\nA redstone comparator can be used to measure the number of stored items.\nSounds[edit | edit source]\nGeneric[edit | edit source]\nDecorated pots switch to the shattered sounds immediately before breaking when destroyed by a non-Silk Touch tool.\nPopped[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition:\n[hide]\nv t e\ndecorated_pot sound type\nSound Subtitles Source Description Resource location Translation key Volume Pitch Attenuation\ndistance\nBlock broken Blocks Once the block has broken block.decorated_pot.break subtitles.block.generic.break 1.0 0.8 16\nBlock placed Blocks When the block is placed block.decorated_pot.place subtitles.block.generic.place 1.0 0.8 16\nBlock breaking Blocks While the block is in the process of being broken block.decorated_pot.hit subtitles.block.generic.hit 0.25 0.5 16\nSomething falls on a block Entity-Dependent Falling on the block with fall damage block.decorated_pot.fall subtitles.block.generic.fall 0.5 0.75 16\nFootsteps Entity-Dependent Walking on the block block.decorated_pot.step subtitles.block.generic.footsteps 0.15 1.0 16\nBedrock Edition:\n[hide]\nv t e\ndecorated_pot sound type\nSound Source Description Resource location Volume Pitch\nBlocks Once the block has broken break.decorated_pot 1.0 1.0\nBlocks When the block is placed break.decorated_pot 1.0 1.0\nBlocks While the block is in the process of being broken step.decorated_pot 1.0 1.0\nBlocks Falling on the block with fall damage step.decorated_pot 1.0 1.0\nBlocks Walking on the block step.decorated_pot 1.0 1.0\nBlocks Jumping from the block step.decorated_pot 1.0 1.0\nBlocks Falling on the block without fall damage step.decorated_pot 1.0 1.0\nShattered[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition:\n[hide]\nv t e\ndecorated_pot_cracked sound type\nSound Subtitles Source Description Resource location Translation key Volume Pitch Attenuation\ndistance\nDecorated Pot shatters Blocks Once the block has broken block.decorated_pot.shatter subtitles.block.decorated_pot.shatter 1.0 0.8 16\nBlock placed Blocks When the block is placed block.decorated_pot.place subtitles.block.generic.place 1.0 0.8 16\nBlock breaking Blocks While the block is in the process of being broken block.decorated_pot.hit subtitles.block.generic.hit 0.25 0.5 16\nSomething falls on a block Entity-Dependent Falling on the block with fall damage block.decorated_pot.fall subtitles.block.generic.fall 0.5 0.75 16\nFootsteps Entity-Dependent Walking on the block block.decorated_pot.step subtitles.block.generic.footsteps 0.15 1.0 16\nUnique[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition\n[hide]\nSounds\nSound Subtitles Source Description Resource location Translation key Volume Pitch Attenuation\ndistance\nDecorated Pot fills Blocks When an item is inserted into a decorated pot by a player block.decorated_pot.insert subtitles.block.decorated_pot.insert 0.9 0.7-1.2[sound 1] 16\nDecorated Pot wobbles Blocks When an item fails to be inserted into a decorated pot by a player block.decorated_pot.insert_fail subtitles.block.decorated_pot.insert_fail 0.9 1.0 16\n↑ Increasing as the pot becomes more full\nBedrock Edition:\n[hide]\nSounds\nSound Source Description Resource location Volume Pitch\nBlocks When an item is inserted into a decorated pot by a player block.decorated_pot.insert 0.9 0.7-1.2[sound 1]\nBlocks When an item fails to be inserted into a decorated pot by a player block.decorated_pot.insert_fail 0.9 1.0\nBlocks When a decorated pot is shattered using a tool in Survival or Adventure mode shatter.decorated_pot 1.0 1.0\n↑ Increasing as the pot becomes more full\nData values[edit | edit source]\nID[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition:\nName Identifier Form\n[hide]\nTranslation key\nDecorated Pot decorated_pot Block & Item\nblock.minecraft.decorated_pot\nName\n[hide]\nIdentifier\nBlock entity decorated_pot\nBedrock Edition:\nName Identifier Numeric ID Form Item ID[i 1]\n[hide]\nTranslation key\nDecorated Pot decorated_pot -551 Block & Giveable Item[i 2] Identical[i 3]\ntile.decorated_pot.name\n↑ ID of block's direct item form, which is used in savegame files and addons.\n↑ Available with /give command.\n↑ The block's direct item form has the same ID as the block.\nName\n[hide]\nSavegame ID\nBlock entity DecoratedPot\nItem data[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition:\nSee also: Data component format\n[NBT Compound / JSON Object] components: the item's components tag.\n[NBT List / JSON Array] minecraft:container: The items contained in this container.\n[NBT Compound / JSON Object]: A single item.\n[NBT Compound / JSON Object] item: The item stack in this slot.\nTags common to all items[show]\n[Int] slot: A slot in this container.

The name \"deepslate\" was eventually chosen because of its location within the world and to more accurately represent that it is a type of slate.[2]\nSimilar to stone, the orientation of the texture varies depending on the coordinates.\nGallery[edit | edit source]\nScreenshots[edit | edit source]\nDeepslate and stone blending at Y=0.\nBelow Y=0, all stone is replaced by deepslate.\nDeepslate block set.\nDeepslate blocks in development.\nDeepslate blocks in development.\nDeepslate with newer textures.\nDeepslate with ores in it.\nA close up of deepslate.\nReferences[edit | edit source]\n↑ MCPE-141330 — [Experimental] Deepslate patches still generating above Y=0 — resolved as \"Fixed\".\n↑ \"The reason is that we felt the name \"Grim\" had too many connotations to a feeling rather than describing what it is.

For example, if a fence is on the ground, attempting to attach a detector rail to the side of the fence causes the detector rail to be attached to the top of the ground next to the fence instead.\nIf updated while on an opened trapdoor, a detector rail (or other rails) breaks drops as an item. Placing a minecart on a detector rail on top of a closed and unpowered trapdoor opens the trapdoor and updates it, causing the detector rail to break. If the trapdoor is powered while the minecart is placed, the trapdoor does not open and the rail does not break. The minecart on the detector rail powers the trapdoor and keeps it closed even if the external power source is removed, allowing the detector rail to stay on.\nWhen placed, a detector rail configures itself to line up with any adjacent rails (including activator rails, powered rails, and other detector rails), as well as adjacent rails one block up. If there are two adjacent rails on non-opposite sides, or three or more adjacent rails, a detector rail lines up in the east-west direction. If there are no adjacent rails, a detector rail lines up in the north-south direction (but if a rail is later placed to the east or west, the detector rail re-orients itself in the east-west direction even if it is already connected to another rail to the north or south). If a rail it would line up with is one block up, a detector rail slants upward toward it (with multiple options to slant upward to, a detector rail \"prefers\", in order: west, east, south, and north). Other configurations can be created by placing and removing various rails.\nMobs avoid walking across a detector rail (or other rails), but can be pushed onto them.\nIt cannot be placed suspended in midair, even with commands.[1]\nRail[edit | edit source]\nMain article: Rail\nDetector rails (and other rails) act as \"roads\" for minecarts. A minecart that enters a detector rail's space from either end of the detector rail continues to move, losing only a little velocity (which can then be increased again with powered rails). A minecart that enters a detector rail's space from the side turns east or south (depending on the detector rail's orientation), or in the downward direction for a slanted detector rail.\nRedstone component[edit | edit source]\nExample for signal strength of a full minecart (right) and a half-full one (left)\nSee also: Redstone circuit\nA detector rail activates when any part of any number of minecart's bounding box is in contact with it, and deactivates when no minecarts' bounding box is in contact. The duration of the signal is always a multiple of 10 redstone ticks (although lag or unloading/reloading a chunk might affect this). While active, a detector rail:\npowers adjacent redstone dust and adjacent redstone repeaters facing away from the detector rail, to power level 15\npowers adjacent redstone comparators facing away from the detector rail to a level corresponding to the fullness of the minecart if it is a minecart with chest or a Minecart with Hopper.\nstrongly powers any full solid opaque block beneath the detector rail to power level 15\nactivates any adjacent mechanism components, including above or below, such as pistons, redstone lamps, powered rails, hoppers, etc.\nComparators give a signal for a minecart with chest or a minecart with hopper\nIf the minecart on the detector rail is a minecart with chest or minecart with hopper, an adjacent redstone comparator facing away from the detector rail outputs a power level proportional to the container's fullness, possibly power level 0. For any other type of minecart (including a regular minecart with a mob riding it) the comparator's output is zero.\nA comparator can read the contents of a minecart with hopper or with chest on a detector rail through a solid opaque block, as it can with other container blocks.\nMob interaction[edit | edit source]\nLike other types of rails, spiders, cave spiders, and wardens are the only land mobs that can walk onto detector rails.\nSounds[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition:\n[hide]\nv t e\nmetal sound type\nSound Subtitles Source Description Resource location Translation key Volume Pitch Attenuation\ndistance\nBlock broken Blocks Once the block has broken block.metal.break subtitles.block.generic.break 1.0 1.2 16\nBlock placed Blocks When the block is placed block.metal.place subtitles.block.generic.place 1.0 1.2 16\nBlock breaking Blocks While the block is in the process of being broken block.metal.hit subtitles.block.generic.hit 0.25 0.75 16\nSomething falls on a block Entity-Dependent Falling on the block with fall damage block.metal.fall subtitles.block.generic.fall 0.5 1.25 16\nFootsteps Entity-Dependent Walking on the block block.metal.step subtitles.block.generic.footsteps 0.15 1.5 16\nBedrock Edition:\n[hide]\nv t e\nmetal sound type\nSound Source Description Resource location Volume Pitch\nBlocks Once the block has broken dig.stone 1.0 1.1-1.2\nBlocks When the block is placed use.stone 1.0 1.2-1.25\nBlocks While the block is in the process of being broken hit.stone 0.3 0.75\nPlayers Falling on the block with fall damage fall.stone 0.4 1.0\nPlayers Walking on the block step.stone 0.35 1.0\nBlocks Jumping from the block jump.stone 0.12 1.0\nBlocks Falling on the block without fall damage land.stone 0.22 1.0\nData values[edit | edit source]\nID[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition:\nName Identifier Form Block tags Item tags\n[hide]\nTranslation key\nDetector Rail detector_rail Block & Item prevent_mob_spawning_inside\nrails rails\nblock.minecraft.detector_rail\nBedrock Edition:\nName Identifier Numeric ID Form Item ID[i 1]\n[hide]\nTranslation key\nDetector Rail detector_rail 28 Block & Giveable Item[i 2] Identical[i 3]\ntile.detector_rail.name\n↑ ID of block's direct item form, which is used in savegame files and addons.\n↑ Available with /give command.\n↑ The block's direct item form has the same ID as the block.\nBlock states[edit | edit source]\nSee also: Block states\nJava Edition:\nName Default value Allowed values\n[hide]\nDescription\npowered false false\ntrue True if rail is activated.\nshape north_south east_west\nnorth_south Specifies the rail's orientation.\nascending_east\nascending_north\nascending_south\nascending_west A rail that ascends toward the direction noted.\nFor example, an ascending_west rail is a straight rail that goes upward from the east toward the west.\nwaterlogged false false\ntrue Whether or not there's water in the same place as this rail.\nBedrock Edition:\nName Metadata Bits Default value Allowed values Values for\nMetadata Bits\n[hide]\nDescription\nrail_data_bit 0x8 false false\ntrue 0\n1 True if rail is activated.\nrail_direction 0x1\n0x2\n0x4 0 0 0 flat track going north-south\n1 1 flat track going east-west\n2 2 sloped track ascending to the east\n3 3 sloped track ascending to the west\n4 4 sloped track ascending to the north\n5 5 sloped track ascending to the south\n6\n7\n8\n9 Unsupported Unused\nVideo[edit | edit source]\nHistory[edit | edit source]\n[hide]\nJava Edition Beta\n1.5\nAdded detector rails.\n[hide]\nJava Edition\n1.0.0 Beta 1.9 Prerelease 6 Detector rails are now broken faster using a pickaxe.\n1.3.1 12w21a Detector rails are now renewable, due to redstone dust being obtainable from trading.\n1.5 13w10a\nA texture for active detector rails has now been added.\n1.8 14w28a Sloped detector rails no longer decrease their hitbox to 2 pixels of a block when activated.\n1.9 15w38a All sloped rail types' hitbox heights have been decreased from 10 pixels of a block to about 2.5 pixels of a block.\n15w44a Detector rails can now be found in chest minecarts in mineshafts.\n1.10 16w21a All sloped rail types' hitbox heights have been increased from about 2.5 pixels of a block to a full block.\n1.11 16w32b All sloped rail types' hitbox heights have now been decreased from a full block to a half block.\n1.14 18w43a\n\nThe textures of detector rails have now been changed.\n19w12b Detector rails can now be placed on glass, ice, glowstone and sea lanterns.\n1.17 20w45a All rail types can now be waterlogged.\n[hide]\nPocket Edition Alpha\nv0.13.0 build 1 Added detector rails.\nv0.14.0 build 1 Detector rails can now be found inside minecarts with chests in mineshafts.\n[hide]\nBedrock Edition\n1.7.0 beta 1.7.0.2 Rails are once again broken by flowing water.

When mined without Silk Touch, diamond ore drops a single diamond. The maximum number of diamonds dropped from a diamond ore block can be increased with Fortune. Fortune I gives a 1⁄3 chance for 2 diamonds, averaging 1.33 diamonds, Fortune II gives a 25% chance (each) to give 2 or 3 diamonds, averaging 1.75 diamonds, and Fortune III gives a 20% chance (each) to give 2, 3, or 4 diamonds, averaging 2.2 diamonds.\nBlock Diamond Ore Deepslate Diamond Ore\nHardness 3 4.5\nTool\nBreaking time (sec)[A]\nDefault 15 22.5\nWooden 7.5 11.25\nStone 3.75 5.65\nIron 0.75 1.15\nDiamond 0.6 0.85\nNetherite 0.5 0.75\nGolden 1.25 1.9\nOptions\nEfficiency\n0\nHaste\n0\nJE\nBE\nLegend\ndrops nothing\ndrops something other than the block itself\ndrops the block itself\nitalicized can be instant mined\n↑ These durations ignore other influential factors (e.g. Mining Fatigue), and are measured in seconds. For more information, see Breaking § Speed.\nNatural generation[edit | edit source]\nSee also: Ore (feature)\nOre feature of diamond ore.\nDiamond ore generates in the Overworld in the form of ore features, and is more common as the altitude decreases. Diamond ore blocks have a chance to not generate if they are exposed to air; however, they do not have a reduced chance to generate if exposed to water or lava, making them appear more commonly on the walls of aquifers.\nDiamond ore generation occurs in four batches:\n7 blobs of 1-5 ores per chunk, from Y=14 to Y=-63. There is a 50% chance to not generate an ore block if it is next to air.\n1 blob of 1-23 ores every 1⁄9 chunks, from Y=14 to Y=-63. There is a 70% chance to not generate an ore block if it is next to air.\n4 blobs of 1-10 ores per chunk, from Y=14 to Y=-63. Ore blocks do not generate if they are next to air.\n2 blobs of 1-10 ores per chunk, from Y=-4 to Y=-63. There is a 50% chance to not generate an ore block if it is next to air.\nDiamond ore can replace stone, andesite, diorite, granite, tuff, and deepslate. Diamond ore that replaces tuff or deepslate becomes deepslate diamond ore, which is more common than its regular variant because diamond ore is more likely to generate at lower altitudes.\nDeepslate diamond ore also generates as part of fossils that generate below Y=0, replacing some of the bone blocks.\nUsage[edit | edit source]\nSmelting ingredient[edit | edit source]\nName Ingredients\n[hide]\nSmelting recipe\nDiamond Diamond Ore or\nDeepslate Diamond Ore +\nAny fuel\n\n\n1\nNote blocks[edit | edit source]\nDiamond ore can be placed under note blocks to produce \"bass drum\" sounds.\nSounds[edit | edit source]\nDiamond ore[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition:\n[hide]\nv t e\nstone sound type\nSound Subtitles Source Description Resource location Translation key Volume Pitch Attenuation\ndistance\nBlock broken Blocks Once the block has broken block.stone.break subtitles.block.generic.break 1.0 0.8 16\nBlock placed Blocks When the block is placed block.stone.place subtitles.block.generic.place 1.0 0.8 16\nBlock breaking Blocks While the block is in the process of being broken block.stone.hit subtitles.block.generic.hit 0.25 0.5 16\nSomething falls on a block Entity-Dependent Falling on the block with fall damage block.stone.fall subtitles.block.generic.fall 0.5 0.75 16\nFootsteps Entity-Dependent Walking on the block block.stone.step subtitles.block.generic.footsteps 0.15 1.0 16\nBedrock Edition:\n[hide]\nv t e\nstone sound type\nSound Source Description Resource location Volume Pitch\nBlocks Once the block has broken dig.stone 1.0 0.8-1.0\nBlocks When the block is placed dig.stone 1.0 0.8-1.0\nBlocks While the block is in the process of being broken hit.stone 0.37 0.5\nPlayers Falling on the block with fall damage fall.stone 0.4 1.0\nPlayers Walking on the block step.stone 0.3 1.0\nBlocks Jumping from the block jump.stone 0.12 1.0\nBlocks Falling on the block without fall damage land.stone 0.22 1.0\nDeepslate diamond ore[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition:\n[hide]\nv t e\ndeepslate sound type\nSound Subtitles Source Description Resource location Translation key Volume Pitch Attenuation\ndistance\nBlock broken Blocks Once the block has broken block.deepslate.break subtitles.block.generic.break 1.0 0.8 16\nBlock placed Blocks When the block is placed block.deepslate.place subtitles.block.generic.place 1.0 0.8 16\nBlock breaking Blocks While the block is in the process of being broken block.deepslate.hit subtitles.block.generic.hit 0.25 0.5 16\nSomething falls on a block Entity-Dependent Falling on the block with fall damage block.deepslate.fall subtitles.block.generic.fall 0.5 0.75 16\nFootsteps Entity-Dependent Walking on the block block.deepslate.step subtitles.block.generic.footsteps 0.15 1.0 16\nBedrock Edition:\n[hide]\nv t e\ndeepslate sound type\nSound Source Description Resource location Volume Pitch\nBlocks Once the block has broken dig.deepslate 1.0 0.8-1.0\nBlocks When the block is placed place.deepslate 1.0 0.8-1.0\nBlocks While the block is in the process of being broken hit.deepslate 0.3 0.5\nPlayers Falling on the block with fall damage fall.deepslate 0.4 1.0\nPlayers Walking on the block step.deepslate 0.3 1.0\nPlayers Jumping from the block jump.deepslate 0.12 1.0\nPlayers Falling on the block without fall damage land.deepslate 0.22 1.0\nData values[edit | edit source]\nID[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition:\nName Identifier Form Block tags\n[hide]\nTranslation key\nDiamond Ore diamond_ore Block & Item diamond_ores\nmineable/pickaxe\nneeds_iron_tool\nblock.minecraft.diamond_ore\nDeepslate Diamond Ore deepslate_diamond_ore Block & Item diamond_ores\nmineable/pickaxe\nneeds_iron_tool\nblock.minecraft.deepslate_diamond_ore\nBedrock Edition:\nName Identifier Numeric ID Form Item ID[i 1]\n[hide]\nTranslation key\nDiamond Ore diamond_ore 56 Block & Giveable Item[i 2] Identical[i 3]\ntile.diamond_ore.name\nDeepslate Diamond Ore deepslate_diamond_ore 660 Block & Giveable Item[i 2] Identical[i 3]\ntile.deepslate_diamond_ore.name\n↑ ID of block's direct item form, which is used in savegame files and addons.\n↑\na b Available with /give command.\n↑\na b The block's direct item form has the same ID as the block.\nVideo[edit | edit source]\nHistory[edit | edit source]\n[hide]\nJava Edition Indev\n0.31 20100128-2200 Added diamond ore.

Diorite usually has a salt & pepper appearance.\nAndesite is diorite's above-ground equivalent: The two rocks come from the same kind of magma, but andesite forms in lava flows. Its fast cooling is what makes it look smoother than diorite.\nGranite is another magma chamber rock, but it's made of more quartz crystals. That is why in Minecraft, granite can be crafted by combining diorite and nether quartz.\nIn the real world, diorite is an extremely hard rock and is difficult to carve and work with.\nIn Minecraft: Story Mode, Reuben's grave on Episode 4 is made out of diorite and a new stair variant of it which cannot be found in Minecraft until the Village & Pillage update, which was announced roughly 3 years after Episode 4. It is unknown whether diorite slabs are present.\nGallery[edit | edit source]\nScreenshots[edit | edit source]\nNaturally generated diorite in a forest.\nNaturally generated diorite and other counterparts in a cave.\nNaturally generated diorite and other counterparts in a mountain.\nA burning skull made of diorite.\nSee also[edit | edit source]\nAndesite\nGranite\nStone\nReferences[edit | edit source]\n↑ MC-236816 — Granite, andesite and gravel strips no longer generate in stony peaks, as well as diorite, granite and andesite strips for stone shores — resolved as \"Works As Intended\".\n↑ MCPE-130185 — Andesite and Diorite are excessively generated throughout the world — resolved as \"Fixed\".\nExternal links[edit | edit source]\nBlock of the Week: Diorite – Minecraft.net on April 13, 2018\nNavigation[edit | edit source]\n[hide]\nv t e\nBlocks\n[hide]\nStructural\nWood/Hypha Logs Stripped Wood Stripped Stems Stripped Hyphae Stripped Block of Bamboo Stripped Bamboo Mosaic Planks\nStone-based Stone Cobblestone Mossy Smooth Stone Stone Bricks Chiseled Cracked Mossy Granite Polished Diorite Polished Andesite Polished Deepslate Chiseled Cobbled Polished Deepslate Bricks Cracked Deepslate Tiles Cracked Tuff Chiseled Polished Tuff Bricks Chiseled\nFrom the Overworld Bricks Packed Mud Mud Bricks Block of Resin Resin Bricks Chiseled Sandstone Chiseled Cut Smooth Red Sandstone Chiseled Cut Smooth Prismarine Bricks Dark\nThe Nether Netherrack Nether Bricks Chiseled Cracked Red Blackstone Polished Blackstone Chiseled Polished Blackstone Bricks Cracked Basalt Polished Smooth\nThe End End Stone Bricks Purpur Block Pillar\nStructural minerals Block of Quartz Bricks Chiseled Pillar Smooth Block of Copper Chiseled Cut Grate\nDecorative minerals Block of Amethyst Block of Coal Block of Diamond Block of Emerald Block of Gold Block of Iron Block of Lapis Lazuli Block of Netherite Block of Redstone\n[show]\nOrnamental\n[show]\nNatural\n[show]\nUtility\n[show]\nCreative or commands only\n[show]\nUnused\n[show]\nUnimplemented\n[show]\nJoke features\n[show]\nRemoved",
