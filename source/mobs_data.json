For the zombie variant, see Zombie Villager. For the non-illager humanoid mob, see Witch.\nFor other uses, see Illager (disambiguation).\nThis article needs cleanup to comply with the style guide. [discuss]\nPlease help improve this page. The talk page may contain suggestions.\nEvery illager in Java Edition.\nIllagers[1] are a type of hostile mob that regularly spawns in woodland mansions, patrols, raids, and pillager outposts.\nIllagers are hostile toward players, villagers (excluding baby villagers), wandering traders, snow golems,‌[BE only] and iron golems. Illagers come in three (or four‌[JE only]) classes: pillager, vindicator, evoker, and illusioner.‌[JE only] In Java Edition, all of these mobs are also part of the illager entity tag.\nContents\n1 Properties\n2 List of mobs\n2.1 Illagers\n2.2 Related mobs\n3 Ravager jockeys\n4 Occurrences\n5 Raid captains\n5.1 Event\n5.2 Effects\n6 Rune\n7 Java Edition\n7.1 Reinforcements\n7.2 Raids\n7.3 Patrols\n8 Bedrock Edition\n9 Video\n10 History\n11 Issues\n12 Trivia\n13 Gallery\n13.1 Renders\n14 References\n15 Navigation\nProperties[edit | edit source]\nAll illager mobs have the following properties:\n\"Johnny\" vindicators do not attack the mob.\nThe mob is immune to the Raid Omen effect.\nThe mob cannot be damaged by evoker fangs.\nThe mob cannot be damaged by a ravager's roar.\nThe mob does not fight back when hit by a missed arrow shot by a pillager or illusioner.\nThe mob does attack villagers but ignores baby villagers, unlike zombie variants.\nThe mob flees from creakings.\nList of mobs[edit | edit source]\nIllagers[edit | edit source]\nEvoker Illusioner\n‌[JE only] Pillager Vindicator\nRelated mobs[edit | edit source]\nRavager Vex Witch\nRavager jockeys[edit | edit source]\nA ravager jockey is an illager that spawns riding a ravager. The riders can be pillagers, vindicators, or evokers.\nThey naturally spawn only in certain waves during raids.\nJava Edition\nA ravager ridden by a pillager spawns in wave 5. Ravagers ridden by vindicators and evokers spawn in wave 7.\nBedrock Edition\nA ravager ridden by a pillager spawns in waves 5 and 7. Ravagers ridden by evokers also spawn in wave 7. Ravagers ridden by vindicators do not spawn during raids, and can be spawned only with commands.\nOccurrences[edit | edit source]\nIllagers spawn naturally in patrols and raids. They will also spawn in their respective structures:\nPillagers spawn in pillager outposts.\nVindicators and evokers spawn in woodland mansions when they are generated.\nVindicators and evokers that spawn naturally in woodland mansions do not despawn. They also do not respawn when killed.\nRavagers spawn exclusively in raids.\nIllusioners‌[JE only] do not spawn naturally and can be summoned only through commands.\nRaid captains[edit | edit source]\nMain article: Raid captain\nIllagers sometimes have their own captain. Any illager has a small chance to be a raid captain with an ominous banner (even when using a spawn egg‌[JE only], or when summoned by commands). Raid captains can spawn in raids‌[JE only] and one pillager raid captain always spawns in patrols.\nIn Java Edition, the ominous banner equips on the illager's helmet slot. In Bedrock Edition, the illager banner equips on the illager's chestplate slot.\nEvent[edit | edit source]\nMain articles: Patrol and Raid\nIllagers have their own in-game events, led by raid captains‌[JE only]:\nPatrol — a naturally spawned group of five pillagers roaming the landscape and monitoring the villages.\nRaid — waves of illagers and witches spawn and attack a village with ominous horn blares. In Java Edition, An illager captain spawns in each wave with other illagers, usually with a vindicator as the captain. It is triggered when a player with the Bad Omen status effect enters a village. Raiders and villagers usually have different behavior in a raid. In Bedrock Edition, any killed raiders drops special loot. Both raiders and villagers celebrate after defeating or saving a village respectively.\nEffects[edit | edit source]\nMain articles: Bad Omen, Raid Omen and Hero of the Village\nKilling a raid captain drops a ominous bottle, which when drank, gives the Bad Omen effect that, when that player enters a village, it becomes Raid Omen. The raid starts where the player got raid omen. The level of the effect increases the enchantment power of pillagers' and vindicators' crossbows and axes, respectively, and omens with a level higher than 1 cause an extra wave of raiders to occur ‌[JE only]. When all waves have been finished in a raid, the Hero of the Village effect is given, which decreases prices when trading with villagers. The level of the effect scales with the level of the omen that triggered the raid.\nRune[edit | edit source]\nMain article: MCD:Illageralt\nThe illageralt alphabet.\nIllagers have an alphabet called illageralt, a rune font from Minecraft Dungeons. This font is currently usable only in Java Edition via commands.\nJava Edition[edit | edit source]\nAll illagers ignore baby villagers, but may still hit them by accident.\nIllagers do not retaliate when hit by a missed arrow shot by a pillager or illusioner.\nA vindicator can disable the player's shield with its iron axe attack, even when riding a mob. If a player fails to land a melee attack on a vindicator that rides a ravager during a raid in Hard difficulty, the vindicator rider can deal great damage to a player without protection from a shield.\nAll illagers, ravagers, and witches within 48 blocks of a bell that has been rung gain three seconds of the Glowing effect, effectively highlighting them through walls.\nReinforcements[edit | edit source]\nOn all difficulty levels, damaged illager mobs call all other illagers of their respective type within an area centered on the attacked illager to target the attacker, as long as the attacker is a non-illager. For example, pillagers attack a skeleton that injures another pillager, but pillagers do not aid a vindicator hit by a skeleton.[more information needed]\nRaids[edit | edit source]\nDuring raids, vindicators can open doors like villagers. They can break wooden doors in Normal or Hard difficulty, if they cannot open the door successfully.[2] Evokers and illusioners gain high movement speed without any effect.\nA raid captain spawns in each wave with other raiders, usually with a vindicator as the captain.\nIllagers pick up ominous banners dropped by raid captains, depends on how many raid captains die in this wave. If the raid captain is still alive, they do not pick up the banner from last wave remains or if thrown by the player.\nPatrols[edit | edit source]\nAll illagers, ravagers, and witches join nearby patrol actively. If a \"Johnny\" vindicator joins a patrol, all patrol members assume the \"Johnny\" vindicator's aggressive behavior.\nBedrock Edition[edit | edit source]\nAll illagers and vexes ignore baby villagers, but pillagers may still shoot them by accident.\nA dispenser can equip an evoker, vindicator, or pillager with armor. However, no armor is visible on them and no armor drops upon death.\nPillagers and ravagers do not purposefully attack other illagers. However, non-pillagers and non-ravagers do attack pillagers who hit them with missed arrows.[3] Vindicators and evokers retaliate against a pillager if the pillager accidentally hits the vindicator or evoker with an arrow, although the evoker fang deals no damage to pillagers. Vexes summoned by an injured evoker can still attack the pillager.\nA \"ravager with vindicator rider\" is unused in Bedrock Edition. It can be summoned by a spawn event command without raid configuration.\nAfter the Texture Update, illagers still use the Java Edition 1.14 snapshot texture, including some of the Marketplace textures (for example, the pillager's arms).[4] Also, a ravager's leg texture in Bedrock Edition is different from that in Java edition.\nVideo[edit | edit source]\nHistory[edit | edit source]\n[hide]\nJava Edition\n1.11 16w39a Added vindicators and evokers.\n1.12 17w16a Added illusioners.\n1.14 18w43a Added pillagers.\n1.18 21w37a Added illageralt.\nIllagers no longer attack baby villagers.\n1.19 22w17a Changed the illager's models.\n1.21.2\nExperiment\nWinter Drop 24w40a Are now afraid of the creaking.\n[hide]\nPocket Edition\n1.1.0 alpha 1.1.0.0 Added vindicators and evokers.\n[hide]\nBedrock Edition\n1.9.0\nExperiment\nExperimental Gameplay beta 1.9.0.0 Added pillagers.\n1.11.0 beta 1.11.0.1 Illagers no longer attack baby villagers.\n?

Issues should be reported and viewed there.\nTrivia[edit | edit source]\nDuring the development of Minecraft Dungeons, Mojang decided that the game needed a significantly larger number of hostile mobs than existed at the time. This lead to the creation of a generically evil faction in the illagers that could be used in any sort of spin-off media.[5]\nJeb stated that illagers could have any agenda or skills necessary to fuel a story's plot. However, these skills should lean more toward being magic-oriented than technical.[5]\nAccording to Minecraft: Mobestiary, illagers were \"expelled\" from villages due to their \"unspeakable activities.\"\nWitches ally with the illagers during raids. Cory Scheviak jokingly explained that witches spawned in raids are just along for the ride.[6]\nAccording to Jeb, illagers were originally called \"ill-willed villagers\" or \"illvillagers\", but \"evillagers\" and \"illagers\" were also suggested. The lattermost option was chosen as it was the shortest.[5]\nFollowing that, \"illager\" is \"fybo\" (bad villager) in Swedish, from \"bybo\" (villager), since it creates the same pun and meaning as the English term.[5]\nGallery[edit | edit source]\nA poster by Mojang Studios of the Village and Pillage update.\nAn illager patrol looking at a villager secretly at night.\nA vindicator from Minecraft Mobestiary.\nThree pillagers and two vindicators attacking a nitwit villager.\nA ravager that is destroying leaves.\nPillager and Vindicator Height comparison.\nAll the illager mobs, including a vex and ravager.\nRenders[edit | edit source]\nA pillager.\nA vindicator.\nAn evoker.\nAn illusioner.\nReferences[edit | edit source]\n↑ \"The Illagers were created because we were talking about having some kind of generic, evil soldier mob in the game—slightly more intelligent than skeletons. It felt natural to have an evil villager. We figured they were ill-willed villagers and so from the beginning they were supposed to be \"Ill Villagers\". And then Tommaso suggested they should be EVIL-agers—and then we cut it down to just Illagers.\"-Jens Bergensten-\"Meet the Vindicator\" – minecraft.net, June 20, 2017.\n↑ MC-255749 — Non-raider vindicator cannot chop down wooden doors.\n↑ MCPE-42373 — Vindicators/Evokers attack Pillagers when hit by them\n↑ MCPE-48628 — Pillager has broken arm texture\n↑\na b c d Minecraft Game Design\n↑ \"Witches aren't illagers - they are just along for the ride!\" — Cory Scheviak\nNavigation[edit | edit source]\n[hide]\nv t e\nEntities\n[hide]\nMobs\nPassive Allay Armadillo Axolotl Bat Camel Cat Chicken Cod Cow Donkey Frog Glow Squid Horse Mooshroom Mule Ocelot Parrot Pig Pufferfish Rabbit Salmon Sheep Skeleton Horse Sniffer Snow Golem Squid Strider Tadpole Tropical Fish Turtle Villager Wandering Trader\nBE & edu only Agent NPC\nNeutral Bee Cave Spider Dolphin Drowned Enderman Fox Goat Iron Golem Llama Panda Piglin Polar Bear Spider Trader Llama Wolf Zombified Piglin\nHostile Blaze Bogged Breeze Creaking Creeper Elder Guardian Endermite Evoker Ghast Guardian Hoglin Husk Magma Cube Phantom Piglin Brute Pillager Ravager Shulker Silverfish Skeleton Slime Stray Vex Vindicator Warden Witch Wither Skeleton Zoglin Zombie Zombie Villager\nBosses Ender Dragon Wither\nUnused Zombie Horse\nJE only Giant Illusioner Killer Bunny\nBE & edu only Elder Guardian Ghost Old Villager Old Zombie Villager\nJoke features Batato Diamond Chicken Love Golem Mega Spud Moon Cow Nerd Creeper Pink Wither Plaguewhale Slab Poisonous Potato Zombie Ray Tracing Redstone Bug Toxifin Slab\nMentioned Alpaca Barnacle Copper Golem Crab Firefly Glare Great Hunger Iceologer Meerkat Moobloom Ostrich Penguin Pigman Rascal Red Dragon Termite Tuff Golem Vulture Wildfire\nRemoved Builder Mob Monster\nMob types Animal Aquatic Arthropod Illager Jockey Monster Undead\n[show]\nOther entities",
