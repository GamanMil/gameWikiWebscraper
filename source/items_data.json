Both types slowly rotate and bob up and down; this is merely a visual effect, the item itself does not actually rotate or bob up and down.\nItem entities that represent a stack of more than one item appear as several items stuck together. Stacks of 1 appear as one item, 2-16 as two items, 17–32 as three, 33-48 as four, and 49+ as five.\nThe rotation rate of the item is approximately 2.87675 degrees per tick, or 57.595 degrees per second.\nBehavior[edit | edit source]\nItem entities come from many sources. Some common ones are:\nThe death of a mob or player.\nA block that is mined by a player, destroyed by an explosion, or washed away by water.\nAn inventory item tossed by pressing the drop item key (default Q on PC, on Xbox, / on Nintendo Switch, on PlayStation) or dragging a stack outside of an inventory window.\nIn the mobile versions of Bedrock Edition, items in the hotbar can be dropped by pressing on the item's slot. The entire stack is dropped.\nA container (other than an ender chest or a shulker box) that is destroyed while holding items inside.\nThe player may be thought of as having an \"item pickup\" box that surrounds their hitbox. This pickup box extends 1 additional block to the horizontal sides, and 0.5 additional blocks up and down. Any item whose hitbox intersects with the pickup box can be picked up. The pickup box is inclusive on the horizontal sides (for distance less than or equal to 1), and exclusive on the vertical sides (distance less than 0.5). When the player's hitbox size changes, such as when crouching or sleeping, the pickup box size changes with it.\nOnce an item entity's hitbox overlaps with the player's pickup box, it can transfer its items. As many items as can fit in the player inventory, excluding the armor slots and the off-hand slot, are transferred. If any item is transferred, a \"plopping\" sound is played. If all items are transferred, the items appear to move into the center of the player. The item entity never physically moves, however, which means it can appear to go through lava and blocks in its path. This can happen through blocks that are thinner than a full block, but also through the shared edge of two full blocks. Unlike experience orbs, multiple item entities can be picked up simultaneously. Dropped items have a delay of 10 ticks (half a second) between appearing and being able to be picked up, or 40 ticks (2 seconds) if thrown by a player, dolphin, or fox.\nItems do not collide with other entities (except boats) and are only moved or stopped by blocks.\nLike other entities, items can be pushed by flowing water and bubble columns, pushed by a piston, launched by a moving slime block, stuck to a honey block, or caught in a cobweb. Items move at faster speeds if ice is placed under the flowing water. When in still water, items float slowly up to the surface.\nIn Java Edition, items can be reeled by fishing rods, costing 3 durability.\nIf an item is within a solid block, it then flies out one of the unobstructed sides, or out of the top of the block if surrounded by solid blocks on all sides. It does this even if the space below is unoccupied; therefore, it is possible to recover an item dropped by breaking a hole in a floor by quickly placing another block there.\nItems visually disappear when the player is about 16 blocks away from them, and reappear when they get closer. In Java Edition, this distance can be adjusted by the \"Entity Distance\" slider in video settings.\nUnlike most entities, items cannot be spectated in Spectator mode without use of the /spectate command.\nWhen an item entity drops within the pickup box of two separate players simultaneously on a multiplayer server, the player who joined first automatically gets the item. If the item is tossed by one of said players, the other player is prioritized.[verify]\nMerging[edit | edit source]\nTwo stackable items of the same type can merge together into a single item entity if the resulting stack size does not exceed that item's maximum stack size and if they are within a 0.5 x 0.25 x 0.5 square bounding box around the other item.\nWhen this happens the item with the largest stack size gets its item count increased while the other is despawned, if the item count is the same the item that is processed first is the one that will be removed.\nItems normally attempt to merge every 40 game ticks (2 seconds), however items moving across block boundaries can be processed every 2 ticks (0.1 s).\nDamage[edit | edit source]\nItems cannot be attacked by players or mobs; attempting to do so simply hits through them. However, they take damage and disappear from environmental or block-based damage such as explosions, fire, lava, and contact with cacti. Items have essentially no health, so they are destroyed by the slightest damage, though if set on fire they may remain for a few seconds before disappearing. Nether stars are immune to explosions, and netherite-based items and tools are immune to fire and float on top of lava. Also, some blocks that normally damage mobs, such as magma blocks, campfires, sweet berry bushes, wither roses and powder snow, do not damage items.\nDespawning[edit | edit source]\nItems despawn after 6000 game ticks (5 minutes) of being in a loaded, entity-ticking chunk; this is affected by the player's simulation distance. If two item stacks merge, the timer is set to the item that has more time remaining. The 5-minute timer is paused when the chunk is unloaded or no longer processing entities. In Bedrock Edition, nether stars do not despawn. In Java Edition, nether stars dropped by a dying wither despawn after 10 minutes, but they despawn after 5 minutes if dropped by any other means.\nItems that fall into the void immediately despawn when they fall below world minumum height - 64 so Y=-128 in the Overworld, Y=-64 in the Nether and the End.\nSounds[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition:\nItem Entities use the Ambient/Environment sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n[hide]\nSounds\nSound Subtitles Source Description Resource location Translation key Volume Pitch Attenuation\ndistance\nItem plops Players When an item is picked up entity.item.pickup subtitles.entity.item.pickup 0.2 1.6-3.4 [sound 1] 16\nBurning Ambient/Environment When an item is destroyed by lava, but not fire[2] entity.generic.burn subtitles.entity.generic.burn 0.4 2.0-2.4 16\n↑ 0.6-3.4 for using /give and items from advancement rewards\nBedrock Edition:\n[hide]\nSounds\nSound Source Description Resource location Volume Pitch\nPlayers When an item is picked up random.pop 0.25 0.6-2.2\nPlayers When an item is dropped random.pop 0.3 0.55-0.75\nBlocks When an item is destroyed by lava, but not fire random.fizz 0.5 1.8-2.4\nData values[edit | edit source]\nID[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition:\nName Identifier\n[hide]\nTranslation key\nItem item\nentity.minecraft.item\nBedrock Edition:\nName Identifier Numeric ID\n[hide]\nTranslation key\nItem item 64\nentity.item.name\nEntity data[edit | edit source]\nSee also: Chunk format\nDropped items have entity data associated with them that contain various properties of the entity.\nJava Edition:\nMain article: Entity format\n[NBT Compound / JSON Object] Entity data\nTags common to all entities[show]\n[Short] Age: The number of ticks the item has been \"untouched\".

Singkatnya: menjadi barang ketika dalam persediaan, dan menjadi balok ketika diletakkan. Misalnya, perahu berubah menjadi entitas ketika diletakkan, dan kasur menjadi kelompok balok. Ketika terpilih di baris AMP (Antarmuka Pengguna, bahasa Inggris: hotbar), barang akan menampilkan nama dirinya dalam waktu singkat di atas baris tersebut.\nSatu-satunya cara menampilkan yang tepat suatu barang dalam lingkungan dunia gim ialah dengan menempatkannya di Bingkai Barang.\nJika suatu barang yang tidak menjadi balok dijatuhkan, barang tersebut akan menjadi entitas, diwakili oleh sprite yang mengambang di atas suatu permukaan di dalam bingkah-bingkah yang termuat selama 5 menit sebelum barang itu menghilang, kecuali ada pemain berjalan melewatinya untuk mengambil sebelum barang tersebut menghilang, atau barang itu diambil oleh satu makhluk, corong atau kereta tambang bercorong, atau dihanguskan oleh api, lahar, Kaktus, atau ledakan.\nBarang yang terbenam akan mengambang menuju permukaan air. Bila air itu berarus, barang akan hanyut mengikutinya.\nCorong menghisap semua barang yang berada di atasnya.\nPenumpukan[edit source]\nBarang bisa ditumpuk 64 buah, 16 buah, atau tidak bisa sama sekali:\nSebagian besar barang dapat bertumpuk 64 buah. Termasuk di dalam golongan ini seluruh jenis balok, dan barang lain-lain.\nBeberapa lain, seperti Bola Salju, Ember kosong, Telur, Tanda dan Mutiara Ender bisa bertumpuk paling banyak 16 buah.\nSebagian lain tidak bertumpuk sama sekali, umumnya yang memiliki umur pakai (Senjata, Zirah serta Alat, Ember berisi, dan Ramuan).\nSemua barang sebenarnya secara teknis bisa dipaksa bertumpuk sampai 127 memakai perintah, meski tidak tampil sama sekali di permainan.\nDaftar nama-nama barang[edit source]\nBarang yang menjadi balok, cairan atau entitas[edit source]\nPerahu Akasia\nPerahu Akasia dengan Peti\nDudukan Baju Zirah\nRakit Bambu\nRakit Bambu dengan Peti\nBenih Ubi Bit Merah\nPerahu Betula\nPerahu Betula dengan Peti\nBotol Sihir\nBusur\nEmber\nEmber Axolotl\nEmber Kod\nEmber Ikan Buntal\nEmber Salem\nEmber Kecebong\nEmber Ikan Tropis\nWortel\nPerahu Sakura\nPerahu Sakura dengan Peti\nBiji Kakao\nBusur Silang\nPerahu Ek Gelap\nPerahu Ek Gelap dengan Peti\nTelur\nKristal End\nMutiara Ender\nMata Ender\nBola Api\nRoket Kembang Api\nPancingan\nPemantik Api\nBeri Bersinar\nBingkai Barang Bersinar\nBingkai Barang\nPerahu Rimba\nPerahu Rimba dengan Peti\nKelp\nEmber Lahar\nTali\nRamuan Jangkar\nPerahu Bakau\nPerahu Bakau dengan Peti\nBenih Semangka\nKereta Tambang\nKereta Tambang dengan Peti\nKereta Tambang dengan Balok Perintah\nKereta Tambang dengan Tungku ‌[JE only]\nKereta Tambang dengan Corong\nKereta Tambang dengan TNT\nKetuat Nether\nPerahu Ek\nPerahu Ek dengan Peti\nLukisan\nBenih Tumbuhan Semar\nKentang\nEmber Salju Serbuk\nBenih Labu\nSerbuk Batu Merah\nBola Salju\nRamuan Ciprat\nPerahu Cemara\nPerahu Cemara dengan Peti\nBenang\nBuni Manis\nBenih Bunga Kecombrang\nTrisula\nEmber Air\nBenih Gandum\nBarang dengan kegunaan di dunia[edit source]\nBarang-barang ini, ketika terpilih di AMP (alias \"tergenggam\"), di tangan lepas (tangan kiri, bagi orang non-kidal), atau terpasang di tempat zirah, dapat digunakan dengan menekan Serang/Hancurkan (klik kiri tetikus) atau Gunakan (klik kanan tetikus), atau mungkin saja melakonkan tindakan khusus (misal, menguntungkan atau merugikan pemain).

Netherite armor cannot be crafted directly, and is obtained by upgrading diamond armor in a smithing table. A turtle shell is a type of helmet, but no other armor items can be crafted from turtle scutes. Chainmail armor is uncraftable, and can be obtained only from mob drops, trading with villagers, or buried treasure.‌[Bedrock Edition only]\nUpgrading[edit | edit source]\nNetherite armor is obtained by upgrading diamond armor in a smithing table. Each piece of netherite armor requires a netherite ingot and a netherite upgrade smithing template. A full set of netherite armor requires 4 netherite ingots and 4 netherite upgrade smithing templates.\nNetherite armor retains the enchantments, prior work penalty, and number of durability points lost (instead of the remaining durability) from the diamond armor.\nName Ingredients\n[hide]\nSmithing recipe\nNetherite Helmet Netherite Upgrade +\nDiamond Helmet +\nNetherite Ingot\nNetherite Chestplate Netherite Upgrade +\nDiamond Chestplate +\nNetherite Ingot\nNetherite Leggings Netherite Upgrade +\nDiamond Leggings +\nNetherite Ingot\nNetherite Boots Netherite Upgrade +\nDiamond Boots +\nNetherite Ingot\nNatural generation[edit | edit source]\nTwo armor stands are found in each taiga village outdoor armory, one equipped with an iron helmet, the other with an iron chestplate.\nGenerated loot[edit | edit source]\nHelmets[show]\nChestplates[show]\nLeggings[show]\nBoots[show]\nIn Bedrock Edition, a sealed room in woodland mansions can appear that has a chest always containing a chainmail boots piece enchanted with Efficiency I.[1].\nMob loot[edit | edit source]\nZombies, skeletons, and their variants that spawn with armor have a small chance of dropping their armor when killed by the player. The dropped armor has a random durability and retains any enchantments it has. Upon death, zombies, zombie villagers, Drowned, skeletons, zombified piglins, and wither skeletons always drop any armor that they picked up and equipped.\nIn Bedrock Edition, pillagers and vindicators that spawn in raids have a small chance to drop an iron helmet, iron chestplate, iron leggings, or iron boots, in a badly damaged state, with a possibility of having a random enchantment.\nIn Java Edition, armorer villagers throw chainmail armor to players who have the Hero of the Village status effect.\nTrading[edit | edit source]\nMain article: Trading\nLeather armor can be bought from leatherworker villagers. These armor pieces have randomly determined color.\nIron armor, chainmail armor and enchanted diamond armor can be bought from armorer villagers.\nBartering[edit | edit source]\nPiglins may barter iron boots enchanted with Soul Speed when given a gold ingot.\nFishing[edit | edit source]\nLeather boots, often badly damaged, can be obtained as a junk item from fishing.\nUsage[edit | edit source]\nArmor can be worn by a player or mob in order to protect them. See § Mechanics for more details.\nEquipping[edit | edit source]\nA player can equip a piece of armor on themself by using it in the main hand (or off hand in Java Edition) by placing it in the correct slot in their inventory, or by dispensing it from a dispenser onto themself.\nArmor slots\nItem Correct slot\nHelmet, Cap, Shell, Mob Head, or Carved Pumpkin Head\nChestplate, Tunic, or Elytra Chest\nLeggings or Pants Legs\nBoots Feet\nIf the armor's respective slot already contains a piece of armor, they are swapped, and the original armor ends up in the player's hand.\nA chestplate provides the most protection per unit of material, followed by leggings. For leather, iron, and diamond armor, boots have equivalent armor points as the helmet, but for chainmail and gold armor, the helmet trumps boots. A turtle shell, in addition to providing protection, also gives the player the Water Breathing status effect.\nEach armor piece fills one inventory slot, and armor pieces cannot be stacked.\nMob interactions[edit | edit source]\nGeneral\nWearing a mob head in the helmet armor slot reduces the distance the corresponding mob detects the player by 50%.\nEndermen\nA player wearing a carved pumpkin in the helmet slot does not aggravate endermen.\nPiglins\nWhile the player is wearing at least one piece of gold armor, piglins behave as neutral mobs instead of hostile. Piglin brutes do not become neutral and remain hostile.\nBlock interactions[edit | edit source]\nPowder snow\nMobs are immune to freezing in powdered snow while wearing at least one piece of leather armor. Mobs do not sink in powder snow while wearing leather boots, and the player can move through the powder snow like scaffolding.\nMagma blocks and campfires\nA player wearing boots enchanted with Frost Walker does not take damage while walking on magma blocks or campfires.\nRepairing[edit | edit source]\nArmor can be repaired by placing two pieces of the same type (e.g., iron helmets) in a grindstone or in the crafting grid. The resulting item has 5% more durability left than the original items combined, but any enchantments are lost. If the total durability of both of the armor pieces is more than the total durability that a piece of armor would have fresh from a crafting table, the extra durability is lost. Repairing armor with an anvil preserves and combines the enchantments, with a rising experience cost for subsequent repairs on the same item.\nUnit repair[edit | edit source]\nMain article: Anvil mechanics § Unit repair\nA piece of armor can be repaired in an anvil by adding units of the armor material's repair material, with each repair material restoring 25% of the armor item's maximum durability, rounded down. Chainmail armor can be repaired in an anvil using iron ingots. Netherite armor can be repaired in an anvil using netherite ingots.\nGrinding[edit | edit source]\n2 pieces of armor can be grinded together in order to repair them.\nIngredients Grinding recipe\n[hide]\nDescription\nTwo matching armor pieces\nThe durability of the two armor pieces is added together, plus an extra 5% durability.\nA piece of armor can also be grinded to remove its enchantments.\nIngredients Grinding recipe\n[hide]\nDescription\nAn enchanted armor piece\nThe enchantments on the armor are removed, but curses are not. This does not change the armor's durability or name.\nThe icons do not have enchantments because invicons for them have not been added yet.\nEnchanted armor can be grinded with unenchanted armor, as long as they both have the same type (i.e. shape and material), which results in disenchanting the enchanted armor and then combining the 2 items together in the same process. 2 enchanted pieces of armor can also be disenchanted and combined in this way (as long as they both have the same type).\nDyeing leather armor[edit | edit source]\nMain article: Dye § Dyeing armor\nIn Java Edition, leather armor can be dyed by crafting it together with 1 or more dyes.\nIn Bedrock Edition, leather armor can be dyed by using it on a cauldron filled with dyed water. This consumes 1 layer of water but does not change the color of the water.\nDyed leather armor also be undyed by using it on a cauldron with undyed water. This changes the water's color to the color of the armor's dye, and changes the leather armor to have no dye color.\nDefault color HEX code for leather armor is\n #A06540.\nArmor trims[edit | edit source]\nMain article: Smithing § Trimming\nArmor can be given trims using an armor trim smithing template, a trim material and any armor piece. Trimmed armor has different patterns and different colors depending on the template and material used.\nIngredients\n[hide]\nSmithing recipe\nAny Armor Trim +\nAny Armor Piece +\nAny Ingot/Crystal\nDisplay of all armor trims on netherite armor[show]\nSmelting ingredient[edit | edit source]\nName Ingredients\n[hide]\nSmelting recipe\nIron Nugget Any iron armor or\nAny chainmail armor +\nAny fuel\n\n\n0.1\nGold Nugget Any golden armor +\nAny fuel\n\n\n0.1\nMob armor[edit | edit source]\nArmor equipped on mobs[edit | edit source]\nSome mobs have a chance to spawn with armor equipped. When a mob spawns with armor, the number of pieces of armor, the type of armor pieces, and whether the armor is enchanted, depends on the difficulty; although, the tier of armor (leather, gold, etc.) has a fixed probability. Mobs can spawn with trimmed armor only from trial spawners. Some mobs also spawn with the ability to pick up armor on the ground and equip it.\nArmor Type Chance\nLeather 37.06%\nGold 48.73%\nChainmail 12.90%\nIron 1.27%\nDiamond 0.04%\nIt is impossible for zombies and skeletons to naturally spawn with netherite armor.\nThe protection provided by armor and armor enchantments works the same with mobs as it does with players.\nThe following mobs can spawn with armor:\nZombie\nBaby Zombie\nZombie Villager‌[JE only]\nBaby Zombie Villager‌[JE only]\nHusk\nBaby Husk\nSkeleton\nStray\nPiglin[2]\nThe following mobs do not naturally spawn with armor, but they can pick up dropped armor (on Normal and Hard difficulty):\nDrowned\nBaby Drowned\nZombified Piglin\nBaby Zombified Piglin\nWither Skeleton\nZombie Villager‌[BE only]\nBaby Zombie Villager‌[BE only]\nThe following mobs do not naturally spawn with armor, and their armor does not render, but they can pick up dropped armor:\nFox‌[BE only]\nBaby Fox‌[BE only]\nThis mob can have armor equipped on it via a dispenser, and the armor does render, but this mob cannot pick up the armor:\nPiglin Brute\nThese mobs can have armor equipped on them via a dispenser‌[Java Edition only][3] or via commands, but the armor does not render, and these mobs cannot pick up the armor:\nVillager\nBaby Villager\nThese mobs do not spawn with armor and it cannot be equipped in survival mode, but if equipped with commands, their armor is visible:\nGiant‌[Java Edition only]\nPillager‌[Bedrock Edition only]\nVindicator‌[Bedrock Edition only]\nEvoker‌[Bedrock Edition only]\nAll other mobs can be equipped with armor via commands, but the armor cannot be seen.\nA helmet protects a mob that burns in sunlight from burning, but this depletes the helmet's durability as it absorbs the damage.

Wolf armor does not work like player armor. Instead, it absorbs all damage it protects against, and decreases its durability by the number of points of damage absorbed.\nMechanics[edit | edit source]\nIn-game, \"armor points\" are just referred to as \"armor\" (e.g. in the tooltip shown when hovering over the item), but the term \"armor points\" is being used in this article to differentiate between the game mechanic and armor items.\nEach piece of armor has two values associated with it: armor points, and armor toughness. The number of armor points or armor toughness the player has is the sum of the armor points or armor toughness of the individual pieces of armor.\nThe amount of damage that armor reduces depends on the total armor points and armor toughness the player has, and on the strength of the incoming damage. Armor becomes less effective as the amount of damage increases. That is, armor reduces a smaller percent of damage for larger damage values. For example, a full set of diamond armor reduces the damage of a zombie's attack by 77% (3HP damage to 0.69HP × 0.345 damage), but reduces the attack damage of a piglin brute by only 67% (13HP × 6.5 damage to 4.29HP × 2.145 damage). There is a minimum amount of damage that armor protects against (20% of the maximum damage reduction) that depends on the total number of armor points (not armor toughness).\nArmor is an attribute modifier and temporarily increases two attributes of the player or mob wearing the armor: armor and armor_toughness. These attributes can also be modified with commands, and the player or mob takes a reduced amount of damage as if they were wearing armor with the same total armor points and armor toughness.\nThe maximum possible damage reduction from armor alone is 80%. Damage can further be reduced by up to 80% from enchantments, and up to an additional 80% by effects (excluding resistance V). Through armor, enchantments, and effects, the maximum possible damage reduction is 99.2%.\nBase protection of each full set of armor by tier\nTier Minimum Maximum\nLeather 5.6% 28%\nGolden 8.8% 44%\nChainmail 9.6% 48%\nIron 12% 60%\nDiamond 16% 80%\nNetherite 16% 80%\nDamage types[edit | edit source]\nThe following types of damage are reduced by armor and, consequently, damage the armor itself:\nDirect (melee) attacks from mobs and players. This includes the Strength and the Weakness effects and damage-increasing enchantments.\nGetting hit with an arrow, a shulker bullet or a thrown trident. This includes extra damage from enchantments (except shulker bullets).\nGetting hit with a fireball from a ghast or blaze, or a fire charge.\nLaser beam of a guardian or an elder guardian.\nDamage from Thorns enchantment, or spikes of guardians and elder guardians.\nTouching a damaging block (fire, lava, magma block, cactus or sweet berry bush).\nThis excludes netherite armor which is not damaged by fire-related sources.\nTouching a pufferfish.\nExplosions.\nFireworks with at least a firework star in the recipe.\nLightning.\nGetting hit with a falling anvil.\nGetting hit with a snowball from a player[upcoming JE Combat Tests] or snow golem.[more information needed]\nGetting hit with an egg from a player[upcoming JE Combat Tests][more information needed]\nThe following types of damage are not reduced by armor and have no effect on the armor itself:\nRanged sonic boom attacks from wardens.\nFall damage (including ender pearls, but Protection and Feather Falling enchantments reduce it).\nOngoing damage from being on fire.\nSuffocating inside a block or due to entity cramming (also includes the world border)‌[JE only].\nDrowning in water (partially for turtle shells).\nStarvation.\nColliding with a block while flying with elytra.\nMagic (Evoker fangs, status effects and instant damage from a potion of Harming or Dragon's Breath) (but Protection does reduce magical damage.)\nFalling into the void or /kill.\nBeing inside of a powder snow block.\nThis excludes if the player or mob wears any piece of leather armor.\nArmor points[edit | edit source]\nThe armor bar as shown in game\nThe total number of armor points that player has is the sum of the armor points of the individual pieces of armor worn, and is visually represented by the armor bar. The armor increases the player's armor attribute while worn. Armor points determine the minimum amount of damage armor reduces. See Damage reduction below to see how damage reduction is calculated.\nThe armor attribute is capped at 30. If commands are used to give the player armor with more than 30 armor points, or to set the player's armor attribute above 30, damage is calculated as if the player had 30 armor points. The armor bar does not show armor points above 20.\nThe following table shows the number of armor points provided by each type of armor that can be worn by the player.\nMaterial Full set Helmet / Cap Chestplate / Tunic Leggings / Pants Boots\nTurtle Shell 2 () 2 () N/A N/A N/A\nLeather 7 () 1 () 3 () 2 () 1 ()\nGolden 11 ( × 5.5) 2 () 5 () 3 () 1 ()\nChainmail 12 ( × 6) 2 () 5 () 4 () 1 ()\nIron 15 ( × 7.5) 2 () 6 () 5 () 2 ()\nDiamond 20 ( × 10) 3 () 8 () 6 () 3 ()\nNetherite 20 ( × 10) 3 () 8 () 6 () 3 ()\nArmor toughness[edit | edit source]\nArmor becomes less effective for higher damage values, reducing the damage by smaller and smaller percentages. Armor toughness mitigates this behavior to a degree. The amount of damage reduced still decreases for higher damage values, but not as much. The total number of armor toughness the player has is the sum of the armor toughness of the individual pieces of armor worn. Armor toughness does not have a visual indicator like armor points. Armor increases the player's armor_toughness attribute while worn. See Damage reduction below to see how armor toughness affects damage calculation.\nCurrently, only diamond and netherite armor have armor toughness.\nThe armor_toughness attribute is capped at 20. If commands are used to give the player armor with more than 20 armor toughness, or to set the player's armor_toughness attribute above 20, damage is calculated as if the player has 20 armor toughness.\nThe following table shows the amount of armor toughness given by armor that can be worn by the player.\nMaterial Full set Helmet / Cap Chestplate / Tunic Leggings / Pants Boots\nTurtle

armor through commands.\nKnockback reduction[edit | edit source]\nEach netherite armor piece gives a knockback resistance (or reduction) of 10%, protecting 40% of all knockback with a full set.\nEnchantments[edit | edit source]\nSee also: Enchanting\nArmor can be enchanted to provide various benefits. Enchantments can provide more protection or allow armor to resist certain types of damage that armor doesn't normally protect against, such as fall damage or fire. Damage reduction from enchantments does not decrease the armor's durability. Armor enchantments do not appear on the armor bar.\nAn armor's material determines how enchantable it is. The higher a material's enchantability, the greater the chances of getting multiple and high-level enchantments.\nLeather Golden Chainmail Iron Turtle Shell Diamond Netherite\n15 25 12 9 9 10 15\nAs with several enchantments, several different levels of protection are possible. The maximum level of a protection enchantment is currently IV (4). Protection enchantments from multiple pieces of armor stack together, up to a calculated maximum.\nEach protection enchantment protects against specific types of damage. The amount of damage reduction depends on the Enchantment Protection Factor (EPF) provided by that enchantment.\nEnchantment Damage reduced for Type Modifier EPF\nLevel I EPF\nLevel II EPF\nLevel III EPF\nLevel IV\nProtection All 1 1 2 3 4\nFire Protection Fire, lava, and blaze fireballs 2 2 4 6 8\nBlast Protection Explosions 2 2 4 6 8\nProjectile Protection Arrows, thrown tridents, ghast and blaze fireballs 2 2 4 6 8\nFeather Falling Fall damage (including ender pearls) 3 3 6 9 12\nWhen a player or mob wearing armor is subjected to damage, the EPFs of all applicable enchantments are added together, capped at 20, and then damage reduction is cappedEPF / 25, giving a maximum reduction of 20⁄25 (80%) at EPF 20.\nBecause of the caps in the calculation, it is possible to achieve maximum protection against specific types of damage with just three pieces of armor. For example, two pieces of armor with Blast Protection IV (EPF 8 each) and a single piece with Protection IV (EPF 4) would give a total EPF of 20 versus explosions. Any additional EPF would be wasted against explosions (but might be useful against other types of damage, if applicable).\nIf the damage is of a type that armor protects against normally, this reduction applies only to the damage that got through the armor.\nIt is possible using /give to obtain armor with an enchantment level higher than what is normally obtainable via normal survival. Using this method, a player could give themselves, for example, a full set of diamond armor with a Protection V enchantment on every piece. Following the algorithm above, we find that, because Protection V has an EPF of 5, the armor reaches the maximum EPF of 20 for all types of damage. Any higher Protection enchantments could be used to reach the cap with just one level XX (20) enchantment, rather than having a full set of enchanted armor, but would be wasted if all pieces shared the same level enchantment.\nThe table below shows all armor enchantments at their max levels:\nArmor Enchantments at Max Levels\nArmor Enchantment Max Level\nProtection IV\nFire Protection\nBlast Protection\nProjectile Protection\nFeather Falling\nRespiration III\nThorns\nDepth Strider\nUnbreaking\nSoul Speed\nSwift Sneak\nFrost Walker II\nAqua Affinity I\nMending\nCurse of Binding\nCurse of Vanishing\nOnly one form of protection can be applied to a piece of armor (i.e. a chestplate cannot have both Fire Protection and Blast Protection, unless using commands to get all protection enchants in one piece of armor). Feather Falling, Frost Walker, Depth Strider and Soul Speed are enchantments applicable only to boots. Respiration and Aqua Affinity are enchantments applicable only to helmets. Swift Sneak is enchantment applicable only to leggings.\nDurability[edit | edit source]\nAny hit from a damage source that can be blocked by armor removes one point of durability from each piece of armor worn for every 4HP of incoming damage (rounded down, but never below 1). The following chart displays how many hits each piece of armor can endure.\nMaterial Helmet Chestplate Leggings Boots\nTurtle Shell 275 N/A N/A N/A\nLeather 55 80 75 65\nGolden 77 112 105 91\nChainmail 165 240 225 195\nIron 165 240 225 195\nDiamond 363 528 495 429\nNetherite 407 592 555 481\nThe chart below shows the durability per unit of material for each piece of armor, compared to that of the boots. The durability per unit does not depend on the tier of the armor.\nHelmet Chestplate Leggings Boots\nDurability/Unit 68% 61% 66% 100%\nThis means that for the same number of leather/iron ingots/gold ingots/chainmail/diamond, boots can take 1.5 more damage than leggings. Thus, chestplates and leggings offer more defense points per unit, but have less durability per unit.\nThis other chart shows the durability of each piece of armor in a set, as a percentage of the chestplate's durability. Additionally, the maximum durability of the chestplate is always a multiple of 16, leggings a multiple of 15, boots a multiple of 13, and helmets a multiple of 11.\nHelmet Chestplate Leggings Boots\nDurability percentage 68.75% 100% 93.75% 81.25%\nArmor worn by a non-player mob does not lose durability when attacked by any means. Helmets that are worn by undead mobs lose durability when exposed to sunlight due to absorbing the mob's damage from sunlight.\nNetherite armor does not lose durability from lava or fire damage.\nSounds[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition:\n[hide]\nSounds\nSound Subtitles Source Description Resource location Translation key Volume Pitch Attenuation\ndistance\nLeather armor rustles

Players in Adventure mode cannot break armor stands.[1] Using an axe costs two durability, with no additional benefit.\nIn Bedrock Edition, if an armor stand is killed by a harming potion while holding a totem of undying, then the armor stand revives instead of dropping the totem, as with any mob holding a totem of undying.\nNatural generation[edit | edit source]\nTwo armor stands are found in each taiga village outdoor armory, one equipped with an iron helmet and the other with an iron chestplate.‌[JE only]\nCrafting[edit | edit source]\nIngredients\n[hide]\nCrafting recipe\nStick +\nSmooth Stone Slab\n\nUsage[edit | edit source]\nPlayers can use armor stands to hold armor, mob heads, carved pumpkins, and elytra, or other items and blocks if it has arms. The stand does not have a GUI, so players interact with it directly. Armor stands can be placed in 8 different orientations. Armor stands cannot be placed if there is not enough room (i.e. the space is occupied by other entities or solid blocks).\nDespite being inanimate, armor stands are living entities, allowing them to be pushed by pistons, moved by flowing water, pulled with fishing rods, pushed by attacks that inflict knockback, and bounced by slime blocks.\nEquipping armor[edit | edit source]\nUsing armor on a stand places the armor in the appropriate slot; if the slot is already equipped with armor, the old armor is swapped with the armor held by the player. Pressing the use control on armor with a bare hand removes the armor and places it in the highlighted hotbar slot.\nEquipping items[edit | edit source]\nIn Bedrock Edition, armor stands have arms by default; in Java Edition, arms can be made visible only by setting the NBT tag {ShowArms: 1b} via commands or external editors. Pressing the use control on an armor stand with arms while holding a non-equippable item places it in its main hand. In Java Edition, shields are always placed in the off-hand instead. If the armor stand already holds an item, it is swapped with the item held by the player.\nItems from an armor stand's main hand can be retrieved by pressing the use control in any empty spot in Java Edition, or from the chestplate zone if empty in Bedrock Edition. In Java Edition, items in the off-hand slot can be retrieved only if the main hand slot is empty; in Bedrock Edition items in the off-hand slot cannot be retrieved unless the armor stand is broken.\nIn Java Edition, commands can be used to equip items in an armor stand's hands even if its arms are not visible.\nDispensers[edit | edit source]\nIn Java Edition, dispensers can place armor stands. Dispensers ignore the normal placement rules of armor stands - this means they can place armor stands inside solid blocks, or if the needed space is occupied by other entities.\nArmor, mob heads, carved pumpkins, or elytra can be automatically placed on armor stands with a dispenser. Unlike players, dispensers cannot swap armor or items already equipped on the armor stand. Additionally, dispensers can equip shields in an armor stand's off-hand if it has arms; in Bedrock Edition, this is the only way to equip shields in the off-hand slot without using commands.\nPosing[edit | edit source]\nThis feature is exclusive to Bedrock Edition. \nIn Bedrock Edition, the pose of the armor stand can be changed by interacting with the armor stand (or pressing the Pose button on mobile devices) while sneaking, or by using a redstone signal. There are 13 possible poses.\nNo. Namespace ID Redstone power\n[show]\nImage\nNaming[edit | edit source]\nUpside-down armor stands in Bedrock Edition\nUsing a renamed name tag on an armor stand gives it a custom name. In Java Edition, the name is not displayed by default,[2] while in Bedrock Edition it is displayed similarly to renamed mobs. In Java Edition, armor stands can also be given custom names by renaming them at an anvil. In Java Edition, a renamed armor stand keeps its custom name when broken. In Bedrock Edition, armor stands named \"Dinnerbone\" or \"Grumm\" turn upside-down.\nFurther customization[edit | edit source]\nArmor stands that have been customized with commands in Java Edition (from left to right: arms, no base plate, small, invisible, custom pose)\nCommands, such as /item in Java Edition or /replaceitem in Bedrock Edition, can be used to give armor stands items that normally cannot be equipped in armor or hand slots. In maps that heavily use command blocks, armor stands can be used to keep scoreboard objectives that are 'global' to the map, run commands, etc.\nIn Java Edition, armor stands can be customized further to have arms, pose, disobey gravity, dual wield, and other things by summoning them using /summon with customized NBT tags. For example, it is possible to create an armor stand with arms using the /summon command. It is also possible to change an armor stand without arms into a stand with arms by using the /data command. The commands are as follows:\n/data merge entity @e[type=armor_stand,sort=nearest,limit=1] {ShowArms:1}, which changes the nearest armor stand into an armor stand with arms.\n/summon minecraft:armor_stand ~ ~ ~ {ShowArms:1}, which summons a new armor stand with arms shown.\n/summon minecraft:armor_stand ~ ~ ~ {Rotation:[0.0f]}, which summons a new armor stand that faces a desired direction (dependent on changing \"0.0f\" to other numbers like \"90.0f\" or \"180.0f\", otherwise it faces the same way as a default armor stand).\n/data merge entity @e[type=armor_stand,sort=nearest,limit=1] {ShowArms:1,Pose:{LeftArm:[0f,0f,0f],RightArm:[0f,0f,0f]}}, which changes the ortientation of the arms of the nearest armor stand (the default orientation of the left arm is: [350f,0f,350f] and [345f,0f,10f] for the right arm).\nOther examples of customization include removing the stone plate below the armor stand, or giving the armor stand a small size (roughly the same size and proportions as a baby zombie).\nBehavior[edit | edit source]\nAn armor stand affected by a night vision potion in Bedrock Edition\nAn armor stand being damaged by the Wither effect potion in Bedrock Edition\nBecause armor stands are entities, they obey gravity, allowing them to fall and rest on non-full blocks such as enchanting tables, snow layers and slabs. Armor stands can't be leashed and can't ride on boats, but in Bedrock Edition, they can sit on minecarts.\nArmor stands wobble slightly when hit by the player. They are not damaged by cacti and sweet berry bushes, but can be broken by arrows and tridents. An armor stand destroyed by an explosion or a firework rocket does not drop as an item. Armor stands in water and lava at the same time are not consumed by the lava.\nBeing living entities, armor stands can also have attributes added to them and can be affected by effects.\nSculk catalysts bloom without spreading when an armor stand is destroyed.[3]\nIn Java Edition, summoning an armor stand with no health causes the death animation.[4]\nAdvancements count armor stands as mobs, and they can be used for advancements such as adventure and arbalistic.\nArmor[edit | edit source]\nAny armor on the stand drops when the stand is broken. Armor stands can display enchanted, trimmed, and all forms of dyed armor. The effects of most enchanted armor have no effect when on an armor stand, with a few exceptions:\nFrost Walker creates frosted ice blocks on water as usual if an armor stand is pushed with a piston, although results are inconsistent.[5][6][7] It also prevents the armor stand from catching on fire as a result of coming into contact with a campfire.\nDepth Strider slows the movement of the armor stand when being pushed with water.\nIn Java Edition, a player may take damage from hitting an armor stand that holds armor enchanted with Thorns.[8]\nSoul Speed negates any speed reduction from an armor stand moving over soul sand.\nFire Protection generally reduces the burn time and damage taken when an armor stand comes into contact with blocks that catch it on fire, though the effects are inconsistent between different levels of Fire Protection and different sources of fire damage. Furthermore, if a collective of 7 or more levels of Fire Protection is applied to the armor an armor stand wears, it will not catch fire or take damage from any fire source.\nIn Java Edition, armor stands wearing leather boots will stand on top of powder snow, where other stands without leather boots will fall through.\nStatus effects[edit | edit source]\nIn Bedrock Edition, armor stands can be affected by status effects.[9] They can be 'killed' by Harming and Decay splash/lingering potions, lava, fire, and campfires, and they play the player death sound and fall to their side and disappear, yielding no armor stand item. If an armor stand is equipped with an item or armor, that item or armor is considered as \"naturally-spawned equipment\" with an 8.5% chance of dropping when the armor stand \"dies\" from the Instant Damage or the Wither status effect. If the dropped item is any form of weapon, tool or armor, it drops in a badly damaged state because the game considers it as \"naturally-spawned equipment\".\nIn Java Edition, armor stands can be given status effects only via commands, as they ignore any effect source in regular gameplay (splash potions, area effect clouds, shulker bullets, etc).[10] Armor stands with status effects do not emit particles, and are immune to most effects except for Glowing, Levitation, and Slow Falling.\nMob interactions[edit | edit source]\nZoglins, goats in Java Edition, and vindicators named Johnny in Bedrock Edition[11] attack armor stands, but the armor stand remains undamaged; pufferfish also inflate when an armor stand is nearby.[12] Statistics classify the armor stand as mobs if the player dies while hitting the armor stand with the thorns enchantment.\nInvisible and marker armor stands[edit | edit source]\nThis feature is exclusive to Java Edition. \nAn invisible armor stand (left) and a marker armor stand with no base plate (right) in Spectator mode.\nIn Java Edition, armor stands can be made invisible or used as markers by setting the NBT tags {Invisible: 1b} or {Marker: 1b} respectively. Both invisible[13] and marker armor stands are invulnerable to all attacks, including explosions and players in Creative mode; they can be removed only using the /kill command. Mobs ignore invisible and marker armor stands.[14]\nInvisible armor stands still render any equipped items, have a hitbox, and can be interacted with by players in any game mode. Similar to mobs affected by the Invisibility effect, invisible armor stands can only be seen by players in Spectator mode, players in the same team as the invisible armor stand, or if the stand has the Glowing effect.\nMarker armor stands are unaffected by physics (gravity, knockback, flowing water, pistons, etc). They have a hitbox size of 0, meaning that players and dispensers cannot interact with them. Due to the lack of a hitbox, it is possible to place blocks in the space visually occupied by a marker armor stand, or target blocks and entities behind it.\nSounds[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition:\nArmor stands use the Friendly Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n[hide]\nSounds\nSound Subtitles Source Description Resource location Translation key Volume Pitch Attenuation\ndistance\nBlock breaking Friendly Creatures When an armor stand is damaged entity.armor_stand.hit subtitles.block.generic.hit 1.0 1.0 16\nBlock broken Friendly Creatures When an armor stand is destroyed entity.armor_stand.break subtitles.block.generic.break 1.0 1.0 16\nBlock placed Blocks When an armor stand is placed entity.armor_stand.place subtitles.block.generic.place 1.0 1.0 16\nBlock placed Friendly Creatures When an armor stand falls onto a block at a high speed, such has being dropped off a cliff. entity.armor_stand.fall subtitles.entity.armorstand.fall 1.0 1.0 16\nBedrock Edition:\n[hide]\nSounds\nSound Source Description Resource location Volume Pitch\nFriendly Creatures When an armor stand is damaged mob.armor_stand.hit 1.0 1.0\nFriendly Creatures When an armor stand is destroyed mob.armor_stand.break 1.0 1.0\nFriendly Creatures When an armor stand is placed mob.armor_stand.place 1.0 1.0\nFriendly Creatures When an armor stand falls onto a block at a high speed[more information needed] mob.armor_stand.land 1.0 1.0\nPlayers When an armor stand dies game.player.die 1.0 0.8-1.2\nData values[edit | edit source]\nID[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition:\nArmor Stand Identifier Form\n[hide]\nTranslation key\nItem armor_stand Item\nitem.minecraft.armor_stand\nArmor Stand Identifier Entity tags\n[hide]\nTranslation key\nEntity armor_stand can_breathe_under_water\nentity.minecraft.armor_stand\nBedrock Edition:\nArmor Stand Identifier Numeric ID Form\n[hide]\nTranslation key\nItem armor_stand 552 Item\nitem.armor_stand.name\nArmor Stand Identifier Numeric ID\n[hide]\nTranslation key\nEntity armor_stand 61\nentity.armor_stand.name\nItem data[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition:\nSee also: Data component format\n[NBT Compound / JSON Object] components: the item's components tag.\n[NBT Compound / JSON Object] minecraft:entity_data: NBT applied to an entity when created from an item.\nSee Entity format.

Arrow entities spawn with a starting velocity calculated using the following process:\nThe direction of the velocity is set as the facing vector of the entity that shot it, or the vector pointing straight out of a dispenser.\nThe magnitude of the velocity is set as 0 to 3 for bows depending on how far they're drawn, 3.15 for crossbows, and 1.1 for dispensers.\nA random vector is added to the previously determined velocity. This vector ranges from\n−\n0\n.\n0\n1\n7\n2\n2\n7\n5\n⋅\ninaccuracy\nto\n0\n.\n0\n1\n7\n2\n2\n7\n5\n⋅\ninaccuracy\non every axis. Inaccuracy is 1 for bows and crossbows, and 6 for dispensers.\nBecause crossbows shoot slightly faster arrows than bows but have the same inaccuracy, crossbows can feel more accurate; Their randomness is smaller in proportion to their total velocity.\nMovement[edit | edit source]\nAn arrow entity follows this list of steps in order when calculating its movement each game tick:\nIf it is intersecting a block's collision box, its inGround NBT value is set to true.\nIf it is on fire and in rain, water, or powder snow (including cauldrons containing water or powder snow), its fire is extinguished.\nIf inGround is true: Expand\nIf inGround is false:\nIt calculates collisions with blocks and entities: Expand\nIts velocity vector is added to its position vector.\nIts velocity vector is multiplied by 0.99 if it's in air or 0.6 if it's in water (this is the \"drag\").\n0.05 is subtracted from its velocity vector's y component (this is the \"gravity\").\nThe arrow movement (when not stuck in a block) can be solved as a recurrence relation to obtain the following formulas:\nV\nt\n→\n=\n0\n.\n9\n9\nt\n⋅\n(\nV\n0\n→\n+\n[\n0\n5\n0\n]\n)\n−\n[\n0\n5\n0\n]\nP\nt\n→\n=\nP\n0\n→\n+\n1\n0\n0\n⋅\n(\n1\n−\n0\n.\n9\n9\nt\n)\n⋅\n(\nV\n0\n→\n+\n[\n0\n5\n0\n]\n)\n−\n[\n0\n5\nt\n0\n]\nWhere\nV\nt\n→\nis the velocity at tick t and\nP\nt\n→\nis the position at tick t. These formulas can quickly calculate the position and velocity at a future tick t given an initial position and velocity. To make them work for arrows in water instead, change 0.99 with 0.6 and 100 with 2.5.\nDamage[edit | edit source]\nThe damage an arrow inflicts on an entity depends on the damage NBT tag, the crit NBT tag, and the arrow's speed.\nThe damage NBT tag is determined by the item that shot it: It is 2 for everything except bows enchanted with Power, in which case it's\n2\n.\n5\n+\npower level\n2\n.\nThe crit NBT tag is given to all arrows shot out of crossbows or fully charged bows.\nThe damage inflicted on an entity is\ndamage NBT tag \n⋅\n speed\n, rounded up to a whole number. If the arrow has the crit NBT tag, it does an additional random amount of damage between 0 and\ndamage\n2\n+\n2\n.\nAverage damage (fully charged bow, point-blank range)\nSource Damage tag Crit tag Starting speed Average damage\nBow (Power I) 3 Yes\n3\n±\n0\n.\n0\n1\n7\n2\n2\n7\n5\n12.25HP × 6.125\nBow (Power II) 3.5 14.75HP × 7.375\nBow (Power III) 4 16HP × 8\nBow (Power IV) 4.5 18.5HP × 9.25\nBow (Power V) 5 19.75HP × 9.875\nBow 2 8.5HP × 4.25\nCrossbow\n3\n.\n1\n5\n±\n0\n.\n0\n1\n7\n2\n2\n7\n5\n9.75HP × 4.875\nDispenser No\n1\n.\n1\n±\n0\n.\n1\n0\n3\n3\n6\n5\n3.5HP × 1.75\nCommon properties[edit | edit source]\nArrows shot from a bow with the Flame enchantment, or shot through lava or fire, catch on fire and show an appropriate animation until they pass through water or rain. They can set other entities they hit on fire for up to 5 seconds (inflicting up to 4HP of fire damage)[citation needed], as well as ignite TNT, candles, and campfires.\nAn arrow shot in a tree\nArrows also stick into blocks they come in contact with and remain there for one minute before disappearing. Such arrows may be retrieved. The 1-minute despawn timer is then refreshed, meaning it takes another minute for the arrow to despawn.\nArrows can get visually stuck in players in Java Edition, although not any mobs. They appear as regular arrows regardless of type.[2]\nSteve covered in arrows\nAlex covered in arrows\nIf the arrow has any custom potion effects (NBT tag CustomPotionEffects), all potion effects, including vanilla potion effects (NBT tag Potion) are removed 30 seconds after the arrow stops moving.\nAn arrow shot at a chorus flower or decorated pot breaks the block; a chorus flower drops itself, while a decorated pot shatters into pottery sherds and/or bricks along with dropping any of the items stored inside.\nRedstone circuits[edit | edit source]\nAn arrow can activate a wooden button, wooden pressure plate, a tripwire, or a target. An arrow continues to power these blocks until it is removed, either due to despawning, or being picked up. Target blocks emit a redstone pulse for one second, as opposed to the static depressed state of the other switches.

This consumes one point of durability from the axe.\nWeapon[edit | edit source]\nAn axe loses 2 points of durability when used as a weapon. Attacking a shielding player with an axe disables the use of all of their shields for 5 seconds. Vindicators, piglin brutes, and other axe-wielding mobs can also disable a shielding player's shield.\nJava Edition[edit | edit source]\nIn Java Edition, damage done when using an axe as a weapon is more than that of a sword of the same tier, though they take longer than a sword to recover, resulting in lower DPS (with the exception of golden axes). The damage dealt and cooldown time depends on the type:\nMaterial Attack Damage Attack Speed Recovery time DPS Lifetime damage inflicted[note 1]\nWooden 7HP 0.8 1.25 seconds (25 game ticks) 5.6 210HP × 105\nGold 7HP 1.0 1 second (20 game ticks) 7.0 112HP × 56\nStone 9HP 0.8 1.25 seconds (25 game ticks) 7.2 594HP × 297\nIron 9HP 0.9 1.1 seconds (22 game ticks) 8.1 1125HP × 562.5\nDiamond 9HP 1.0 1 second (20 game ticks) 9.0 7029HP × 3514.5\nNetherite 10HP 1.0 1 second (20 game ticks) 10.0 10160HP × 5080\n↑ The formula to find the total lifetime damage is ceil(durability ÷ 2) × damage per hit. The durability is halved then ceiled because axes take double durability when used as a weapon, and the last 1 durability can also deal damage. The formula also ignores enchantments and critical hits, and assumes each attack is performed at maximum charge.\nBedrock Edition[edit | edit source]\nIn Bedrock Edition, axes always attack instantly and deal 1HP less damage than a sword of the same quality.\nMaterial Damage\nWooden 4HP\nGolden\nStone 5HP\nIron 6HP\nDiamond 7HP\nNetherite 8HP\nRepairing[edit | edit source]\nCombining[edit | edit source]\nIngredients Crafting recipe\n[hide]\nDescription\nDamaged Wooden Axe or\nDamaged Stone Axe or\nDamaged Iron Axe or\nDamaged Golden Axe or\nDamaged Diamond Axe or\nDamaged Netherite Axe\n\n\nThe durability of the two axes is added together, plus an extra 5% durability.\nIngredients Grinding recipe\n[hide]\nDescription\n2x Damaged Wooden Axe or\n2x Damaged Stone Axe or\n2x Damaged Iron Axe or\n2x Damaged Golden Axe or\n2x Damaged Diamond Axe or\n2x Damaged Netherite Axe\nThe durability of the two axes is added together, plus an extra 5% durability.\nAnvil repair[edit | edit source]\nMain article: Anvil mechanics § Unit repair\nName Ingredients\n[hide]\nAnvil recipe\nWooden Axe Damaged Wooden Axe +\nAny Planks\nWooden Axe\nStone Axe Damaged Stone Axe +\nCobblestone or\nBlackstone or\nCobbled Deepslate\nStone Axe\nIron Axe Damaged Iron Axe +\nIron Ingot\nIron Axe\nGolden Axe Damaged Golden Axe +\nGold Ingot\nGolden Axe\nDiamond Axe Damaged Diamond Axe +\nDiamond\nDiamond Axe\nNetherite Axe Damaged Netherite Axe +\nNetherite Ingot\nNetherite Axe\nAn axe can be repaired in an anvil by adding units of the tiers' repair material, with each repair material restoring 25% the axe's maximum durability, rounded down.

A balloon remains grounded if tied to a fence or a wall. When untied by right-clicking on it, a balloon rises into the air quickly.\nWhen a balloon is shot by an arrow, wind charge, or a trident, or floats into a solid block, it pops, summons particles, and is destroyed. It drops nothing. A balloon tied to a fence post bursts when a player strikes it from any direction.\nA balloon attached to a mob can lift up the mob, more slowly than the ballon rises on its own. If tied to a mob whose mass is less than or equal to 1, the balloon floats away and carries the mob high into the air, before both eventually disappear. Destroying or detaching the balloon from its suspended mob causes the mob to fall and take fall damage. When attached to a mob whose mass is above 1, the balloon floats up to the limit of its tether, briefly yanking the mob upward by a fraction of a block, but otherwise the mob remains on the ground.\nA heavier mob with mass above 1 falls slowly while attached to a balloon. The balloon despawns when the mob falls more than 16 blocks. Currently, the only heavy mob that can have a balloon attached is the iron golem. A balloon cannot be attached to a ravager.\nA player holding a balloon falls normally and takes normal fall damage.[more information needed]\nAttachable mobs and entities[edit | edit source]\nGenerally, non-hostile terrestrial mobs can be attached to a balloon. A balloon can attach to almost any entity that a lead can attach to, except for axolotls and frogs. Balloons can also attach to pandas, which leads cannot. A mob can have both a lead and balloon attached at the same time if the lead is attached before the balloon.\nBalloon-attachable mobs/entities\nMob/Entity\n[hide]\nMass\nAllay 0.5\nArmadillo 1.0\nBee 0.5\nBoat 1.0\nBoat with Chest 1.0\nCamel 1.0\nCat 0.6\nChicken 0.6\nCow 1.0\nDolphin (in water only) 1.0\nDonkey 1.0\nFox 0.6\nGlow Squid 0.5\nGoat 1.0\nHoglin 1.0\nHorse 1.0\nIron Golem 2.0\nLlama 1.0\nMule 1.0\nMooshroom 1.0\nOcelot 0.7\nPanda 1.0\nParrot 1.0\nPig 0.75\nPolar Bear 1.0\nRabbit 0.4\nSheep 0.75\nSkeleton Horse 0.6\nSniffer 1.0\nSnow Golem 1.0\nSquid 0.5\nStrider 1.0\nTrader Llama[note 1] 1.0\nWolf 0.8\nZoglin 1.0\nZombie Horse 1.0\n↑ If one or both trader llamas are lifted by balloons, the wandering trader attached to them by leads remains on the ground.\nSounds[edit | edit source]\n[hide]\nSounds\nSound Source Description Resource location Volume Pitch\nFriendly Creatures When a balloon collides with a block from above balloon.pop 10.0 1.75/2.0\nData values[edit | edit source]\nID[edit | edit source]\nName Identifier Numeric ID Form\n[hide]\nTranslation key\nBalloon balloon 598 Item\nitem.balloon.black.name\nitem.balloon.red.name\nitem.balloon.green.name\nitem.balloon.brown.name\nitem.balloon.blue.name\nitem.balloon.purple.name\nitem.balloon.cyan.name\nitem.balloon.silver.name\nitem.balloon.gray.name\nitem.balloon.pink.name\nitem.balloon.lime.name\nitem.balloon.yellow.name\nitem.balloon.lightBlue.name\nitem.balloon.magenta.name\nitem.balloon.orange.name\nitem.balloon.white.name\nBalloon Identifier Numeric ID\n[hide]\nTranslation key\nEntity balloon 107\nentity.balloon.name\nMetadata[edit | edit source]\nIn Bedrock Edition, balloon items use the following data values:\nDV\n[hide]\nDescription\n0 White\n1 Orange\n2 Magenta\n3 Light blue\n4 Yellow\n5 Lime\n6 Pink\n7 Gray\n8 Silver\n9 Cyan\n10 Purple\n11 Blue\n12 Brown\n13 Green\n14 Red\n15 Black\nunused Purple\nHistory[edit | edit source]\n[hide]\nBedrock Edition\n1.4.0 beta 1.2.20.1\nAdded balloons.\n1.18.10 beta 1.18.10.24 Bees, boats, tamed cats, dolphins, glow squids, goats, hoglins, ocelots, pandas, parrots, polar bears, squids, striders, tamed wolves, and zoglins can now be leashed.\n1.18.30 beta 1.18.30.28 Added boats with chests, which can be leashed.\n1.21.0 Preview 1.21.0.21 Balloons now appear in the Creative inventory when the Education edition toggle is on.\n[hide]\nMinecraft Education\n1.0.27\nAdded balloons.\n1.18.32 1.18.10.04 Bees, boats, tamed cats, dolphins, glow squids, goats, hoglins, ocelots, pandas, parrots, polar bears, squids, striders, tamed wolves, and zoglins can now be leashed.\n1.21.03 Preview 1.21.01.0 Balloons now appear in the Creative inventory.\nIssues[edit | edit source]\nIssues relating to \"Balloon\" are maintained on the bug tracker.

The seeds require a light level of 8 or greater to plant‌[Java Edition only] and 9 or greater to grow. In Bedrock Edition they can be planted at any light level, but need a internal light level of 9 to grow. When fully grown, the plant can be broken to harvest beetroot seeds and beetroots.\nWhile beetroot crops have only four growth stages compared to eight for wheat, carrots and potatoes, each growth tick has a 1⁄3 chance of not advancing the growth stage and therefore beetroot grows slightly faster than other crops.\nCrops grow faster if the farmland they are planted in is hydrated. One application of bone meal has a 75% chance of advancing growth by one stage. This is less effective than for other crops: an average of 5 1⁄3 are needed to fully grow beetroot compared to 2 2⁄7 for other crops.\nCrops break if pushed by a piston or if their supporting farmland breaks or turns to dirt (e.g. by being trampled), dropping their usual drops.\nBreeding[edit | edit source]\nLike other seeds, beetroot seeds can be used to breed chickens, lead chickens around, and make baby chickens grow up faster by 10% of the remaining time.\nTaming[edit | edit source]\nLike other seeds, beetroot seeds can be used to tame parrots.\nComposting[edit | edit source]\nPlacing beetroot seeds into a composter has a 30% chance of raising the compost level by 1.\nSounds[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition:\n[hide]\nv t e\ncrop sound type\nSound Subtitles Source Description Resource location Translation key Volume Pitch Attenuation\ndistance\nBlock broken Blocks Once the block has broken block.crop.break subtitles.block.generic.break 0.9 0.8 16\nBlock placed Blocks When the block is placed item.crop.plant[sound 1] subtitles.block.generic.place 0.45 varies [sound 2] 16\nBlock breaking Blocks While the block is in the process of being broken block.grass.hit subtitles.block.generic.hit 0.25 0.5 16\nSomething falls on a block Entity-Dependent Falling on the block with fall damage block.grass.fall subtitles.block.generic.fall 0.5 0.75 16\nFootsteps Entity-Dependent Walking on the block block.grass.step subtitles.block.generic.footsteps 0.15 1.0 16\n↑ Unlike all other block placement sound events, these are listed under items.

Plains villagers buy oak boats, taiga and snowy villagers buy spruce boats, desert and jungle villagers buy jungle boats, savanna villagers buy acacia boats, and swamp villagers buy dark oak boats.\nFuel[edit | edit source]\nA boat used as fuel in a furnace lasts 60 seconds, smelting up to 6 items.\nTransportation[edit | edit source]\nSee also: Transportation and Riding\nEntering[edit | edit source]\nA player enters a boat by using it, if the boat is not fully occupied (boats can hold two entities). Unlike beds, there is no message above the hotbar for attempting to enter a fully occupied boat.[2]\nExiting[edit | edit source]\nA boat can be exited by sneaking or, in Bedrock Edition, pressing down the right analog stick on a controller, tapping the \"Leave Boat\" button when using touch controls, or jumping. When exiting a boat, the player is placed in the direction the player is facing, or, if facing directly up or down, the player is placed in front of the boat. The exiting player is placed on land if possible from the dismounting position.\nMotion[edit | edit source]\nBoats do not turn with mouse-look.\nWith a keyboard or gamepad, boats are controlled using the forward, left (turns left), right (turns right), and backward keys. Using the sprint key increases the field of vision, but does not increase speed as if sprinting.\nWith touchscreen controls, two buttons for steering appear. The right button or key steers to the left, and the left button or key steers to the right. Pressing both buttons or keys moves the boat forward.\nIn Java Edition, boats can be ridden against a current, but cannot be ridden upstream to a higher elevation. A boat lift, usually made from tripwire, pistons, and optionally a slime block, can be used to move a boat up. Bubble columns created with soul sand can also be used to push boats upward. These mechanisms can also be used in Bedrock Edition but are usually unnecessary because boats can be ridden upward in descending water, as well as follow upward stair-step currents.\nBehavior[edit | edit source]\nSpeed[edit | edit source]\nBoats move according to the player's control or water currents, with speed affected by the surface traversed. Boats move extremely quickly on ice,[3] allowing for the construction of fast transportation systems in any dimension.\nDrag is applied proportionally against the boat’s current velocity, causing its speed to decay exponentially.\nWhen the forward or backward command is issued, a constant thrust is applied relative to the boat's facing direction, exponentially approaching the top speed at which thrust balances drag.The backward thrust is one-eighth that of the forward thrust’s strength.\nWhen strafe commands are issued, a constant torque is applied to increase the boat's rotation speed, with the same drag mechanism limiting the maximum rate of rotation.\nSubstance Top Speed Max Yaw Rate\nWater 8.0 blocks/s 200 deg/s\nIce, frosted ice, packed ice 40 blocks/s 1000 deg/s\nBlue ice 72.72... blocks/s 1818.18... deg/s\nLand 2.0 blocks/s 50 deg/s\nSlime block 1.181 blocks/s 100 deg/s\nHoney block, soul sand 1.053 blocks/s\nThe torque and thrust values differ between Java and Bedrock edition, as are the linear drag coefficients of various surfaces which are proportionally scaled to produce the same top speed/max yaw rate between two editions\nFront Thrust Back Thrust Torque Blue Ice Pack/Frost/Ice Water Slime Land\nJava Edition 16 blocks/s2 2 blocks/s2 400 deg/s2 0.22 s-1 0.4 s-1 2 s-1 4 s-1 8 s-1\nBedrock Edition ??? ??? ??? ??? ??? ??? ??? ???\nFlotation[edit | edit source]\nThe animation of an oak boat when atop a bubble column.\nA boat floats atop still or flowing water. In Java Edition, a boat sinks if it enters a waterfall.[4] In Bedrock Edition, a boat does not sink when submerged but floats up. This feature lets a player contrive stepped uphill water flows to propel a boat uphill using only flowing water.\nWhen a boat moves over a bubble column, it begins to shake. If the bubbles are caused by a magma block, all passengers are expelled and the boat sinks.\nIn Java Edition, a sunken boat cannot be re-floated until a bubble column pushes it up or it is broken by the player. In Bedrock Edition, a boat resumes floating when it emerges from the currents keeping it down, or when the bubble column is blocked or removed.\nDolphins chase players riding a boat in motion, occasionally bumping the boat, causing it to shake briefly.\nDestruction[edit | edit source]\nAs boats are entities, they have health. Boats effectively have just over 4HP‌[Java Edition only] (exactly 4 damage is not enough to destroy a boat), and regenerate 1⁄10 per game tick. Due to bug MCPE-62683 boats in Bedrock Edition have 40HP × 20 health.\nBoats can be destroyed by explosions, fire and lava (but not magma blocks), cactus, and by being punched/shot by mobs, such as drowned. Boats made invulnerable with commands cannot be broken by any of these, but they still cannot be used to travel on lava because they sink.\nWhen a boat is destroyed, it drops itself in item form.\nPassengers[edit | edit source]\nMultiple mobs in 2 types of boats.\nBoats can support two riders, including mobs. A mob cannot exit a boat and is trapped until the boat gets destroyed, or until the player uses a fishing rod or lead to remove the mob. This can be used to transport mobs, although hostile mobs still attack while in boats. Mobs riding a boat don't despawn‌[Java Edition only] and don't count toward the mob cap.[5]\nA player cannot both move (row) and use items at the same time. It is still possible to initialize item use (e.g. start eating) and row the boat while the item is still in the middle of the use animation. Although the rowing animation overrides the item use animation, the item can still be successfully consumed.\nBeing in a boat limits the player's mouse-look to the forward 210° arc in Java Edition and 180° in Bedrock Edition.\nUnderwater boats cannot be ridden. When the boat is underwater, all passengers in it are expelled.\nDamage prevention[edit | edit source]\nRiding a boat does not deplete hunger, making it an efficient way to travel.\nBoats can completely nullify fall damage for themselves and any players/mobs inside, making them useful for travel through mountains or through the Nether. In previous Java Edition versions, a bug caused the player to take full damage at specific heights; for example, 49 or 51 blocks[6][7]. However, this has been patched out in 1.21.2.[8]\nCollision[edit | edit source]\nA boat has a solid collision box, which means players and other entities can't go through it even with high speed. Falling blocks are also blocked by boats.\nIn Java Edition, a boat falling on top of an entity stops on top of the entity. In Bedrock Edition, a falling boat can go through other entities.\nRiding a boat over a lily pad causes the lily pad to drop, although the boat's speed stutters a bit.\nMobs[edit | edit source]\nMost mobs can ride boats. Mobs cannot exit the boat unless the boat is destroyed, sinks, or moves over a bubble column.\nMobs can be picked up into the boat when they collide with the side of the boat. A mob cannot control the boat. In Java Edition, a boat being ridden by a player cannot pick up a mob. In Bedrock Edition, mobs can be picked up by a boat being ridden by a player. In Minecraft Education, even tripod cameras can ride boats.\nA mob can ride a boat if it is narrower than a boat, and is neither an aquatic[9] nor ambient animal. The following mobs are unable to ride in a boat:\nAgent\nBat\nCod\nCreaking\nDolphin\nElder guardian\nEnder dragon\nGhast\nGiant\nGlow squid\nIron golem\nNPC\nPufferfish\nRavager\nSalmon\nSpider\nSquid\nTadpole\nTropical fish\nWarden[10]\nWither[10]\nThe baby counterparts of these mobs are able to ride in boats, but not the adult versions:\nCamel\nDonkey\nHoglin\nHorse\nMule\nPolar bear\nSkeleton horse\nSniffer\nZoglin\nZombie horse\nAdditionally, few types of mobs can have various Size values, which can prevent them from riding boats:\nSlime above size 1\nMagma cube above size 1\nPhantom above size 3\nLead[edit | edit source]\nLeads can be attached to boats and can break when stretched too far due to boats moving much slower on land.\nThe lead has no effect if a player is riding the boat. However, if any mob is riding the boat, the boat can be tugged along. This includes villagers, making transportation easier in early game with just a few boats and leads.\nSounds[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition:\nBoats use the Friendly Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n[hide]\nSounds\nSound Subtitles Source Description Resource location Translation key Volume Pitch Attenuation\ndistance\nRowing Friendly Creatures While a boat is rowed on land entity.boat.paddle_land subtitles.entity.boat.paddle_land 1.0 0.8-1.2 16\nRowing Friendly Creatures While a boat is rowed in water entity.boat.paddle_water subtitles.entity.boat.paddle_water 0.8 0.8-1.2 16\nBedrock Edition:\n[hide]\nSounds\nSound Source Description Resource location Volume Pitch\nPlayers While a boat is rowed in water random.swim ? 0.6-1.4\nData values[edit | edit source]\nID[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition:\nName Identifier Form Item tags\n[hide]\nTranslation key\nOak Boat oak_boat Item boats\nitem.minecraft.oak_boat\nSpruce Boat spruce_boat Item boats\nitem.minecraft.spruce_boat\nBirch Boat birch_boat Item boats\nitem.minecraft.birch_boat\nJungle Boat jungle_boat Item boats\nitem.minecraft.jungle_boat\nAcacia Boat acacia_boat Item boats\nitem.minecraft.acacia_boat\nDark Oak Boat dark_oak_boat Item boats\nitem.minecraft.dark_oak_boat\nMangrove Boat mangrove_boat Item boats\nitem.minecraft.mangrove_boat\nCherry Boat cherry_boat Item boats\nitem.minecraft.cherry_boat\nPale Oak Boat pale_oak_boat Item boats\nitem.minecraft.pale_oak_boat\nBamboo Raft bamboo_raft Item boats\nitem.minecraft.bamboo_raft\nName\n[hide]\nIdentifier\nOak Boat oak_boat\nSpruce Boat spruce_boat\nBirch Boat birch_boat\nJungle Boat jungle_boat\nAcacia Boat acacia_boat\nDark Oak Boat dark_oak_boat\nMangrove Boat mangrove_boat\nCherry Boat cherry_boat\nPale Oak Boat pale_oak_boat\nBamboo Raft bamboo_raft\nBedrock Edition:\nName Identifier Alias ID Numeric ID Form Item tags\n[hide]\nTranslation key\nOak Boat oak_boat boat / 0 375 Item minecraft:boats\nitem.boat.oak.name\nSpruce Boat spruce_boat boat / 1 378 Item minecraft:boats\nitem.boat.spruce.name\nBirch Boat birch_boat boat / 2 376 Item minecraft:boats\nitem.boat.birch.name\nJungle Boat jungle_boat boat / 3 377 Item minecraft:boats\nitem.boat.jungle.name\nAcacia Boat acacia_boat boat / 4 379 Item minecraft:boats\nitem.boat.acacia.name\nDark Oak Boat dark_oak_boat boat / 5 380 Item minecraft:boats\nitem.boat.big_oak.name\nMangrove Boat mangrove_boat boat / 6 643 Item minecraft:boats\nitem.boat.mangrove.name\nCherry Boat cherry_boat boat / 8 657 Item minecraft:boats\nitem.boat.cherry.name\nPale Oak Boat pale_oak_boat boat / 9 722 Item minecraft:boats\nitem.boat.pale_oak.name\nBamboo Raft bamboo_raft boat / 7 661 Item minecraft:boats\nitem.boat.bamboo.name\nEntity Identifier Numeric ID\n[hide]\nTranslation key\nBoat boat 90\nentity.boat.name\nEntity data[edit | edit source]\nBoats have entity data associated with them that contain various properties of the entity.\nJava Edition:\nMain article: Entity format\n[NBT Compound / JSON Object] Entity data\nTags common to all boats[show]\nTags common to all entities[show]\nBoat Type[show][edit]\nBedrock Edition:\nSee Bedrock Edition level format/Entity format.\nAchievements[edit | edit source]\n[hide]\nIcon Achievement In-game description Actual requirements (if different) Gamerscore earned Trophy type (PS)\nPS4 Other\nWhatever Floats Your Goat Get in a boat and float with a goat Use a boat and put a goat inside that boat, then ride it. 20 Bronze\nAdvancements[edit | edit source]\nIcon Advancement In-game description Actual requirements (if different)\nWhatever Floats Your Goat!

They now have oars for paddling and are more durable and now allows passengers to board.\nMobs can now board boats, though they can no longer control them.\nA new set of controls have been introduced: it includes holding down the right and left keys to move forward, and using the right key to move the right oar, turning the boat to the left (and vice-versa). Mouse movement no longer turns boats, and the forward and back keys no longer have any effect.\nPlayers can no longer use items or attack from boats unless they were at a complete stop.\nThe crafting recipe for boats has been changed to require a wooden shovel as shown below.\nIngredients\n[hide]\nCrafting recipe\nOak Planks +\nWooden Shovel\n\nBoats no longer break snow layers they run into.\n15w42a The new boats are now comparable in speed to the old boats (slightly faster than sprinting), though with less momentum.\nPlayers can now use items and attack immediately after they stop rowing.\n15w43c The texture of boats has been remapped, so that they now have a separate texture per oar and per side of the boat.\n15w51a Boats now drop their corresponding planks when broken.\n16w04a Boats are now faster and now move forward and backward using the forward and backward keys respectively, and steer left and right using the left and right keys respectively.

The controls are now more similar to boats before the overhaul.\nBoats now sink when underwater, or within flowing water of any depth.\nThe crafting recipe of boats has been restored to the original recipe, no longer requiring a wooden shovel as it has since 15w41a (though matching wood planks is still required).\nRiding a boat no longer subjects water-sensitive mobs to being damaged by water, and no longer protects sunlight-sensitive mobs from being damaged by sunlight.\nDismounting in a boat now attempts to place the player on land.\n16w05a Boats now travel extremely fast on ice, packed ice and frosted ice.[3]\n16w06a Riding entities such as boats are now run by the client rather than by the server.\n1.11 16w32a The player's hunger bar is now visible when riding in a boat.\n16w33a Boats can now be used to fuel furnaces.\n16w39c Boats placed by dispensers now face the same way as the dispenser, instead of toward the dispenser.[11]\n1.12 17w17a Boat paddling sounds have been added.\n1.13 18w06a Boats as fuel now smelt 1 item in a furnace instead of 2.\n18w15a Added blue ice, which allows boats to travel even faster on it.\n1.14 18w43a\nThe textures of all boats have been changed.\n18w50a The textures of all boats have been changed to match the new planks.\n19w11a Fisherman villagers now buy boats.\n1.15 19w37a Boats as fuel now smelt 6 items in a furnace instead of 1.\n1.16 20w18a Mobs in boats no longer despawn.\n1.19 22w11a Added mangrove boats.\n22w12a Boats can now be used to craft boats with chests.\nThe textures of all boat items (except mangrove) have been changed.[12]\n22w14a Due to the addition of the mangrove tree and mangrove swamp, mangrove boats are now obtainable and renewable.\n22w15a The textures of all boat item textures have been changed.\nOctober 15, 2022 Bamboo rafts were announced at Minecraft Live 2022.\n1.19.3\nExperiment\nUpdate 1.20 22w42a Added bamboo rafts.\n22w45a The item texture of the bamboo raft has been changed.\n1.19.4\nExperiment\nUpdate 1.20 23w07a Added cherry boats.\n1.20 23w12a Bamboo rafts and cherry boats are now available without using the \"Update 1.20\" experimental data pack.\n1.21 Pre-release 1 Boats are now leashable.\n1.21.2 24w37a Boats no longer drop planks and sticks when crashed, which at this point was only ever possible due to a rare bug.\nThe remaining code for boats that caused them to be destroyed like in pre-1.9 has been removed.[13] Prior to this point, falling from very specific heights would destroy the boat and damage the rider.\n1.21.2\nExperiment\nWinter Drop 24w40a Added pale oak boats.\n1.21.4 24w44a Pale oak boats are now available without using the \"Winter Drop\" experimental data pack.\n[hide]\nPocket Edition Alpha\nSeptember 19, 2014 Tommaso Checchi tweeted a picture of a player riding a boat, stating that the most important thing is to \"get the paddling right.\"\nThe model used by boats is currently a minecart.\nJanuary 26, 2015 Tommaso Checchi tweets a screenshot of multiple riders in a single boat.\nThe model used by boats is now a minecart which has been squished vertically, and tinted brown.\nFebruary 20, 2015 Tommaso Checchi tweets a screenshot of multiple boats with only mobs in them.\nBoats now have a proper model with paddles.\nv0.11.0 build 1\nAdded boats.

Its inventory can be accessed by sneaking and interacting with the boat with chest, interacting with the part of the boat with chest that actually contains the chest while another player or entity is inside the boat, or by opening the player's inventory while inside the boat. This means that the player cannot access armor slots without exiting the boat.\nWhen a boat with chest moves above, underneath, or beside a hopper, its inventory is filled or drained accordingly. Due to the size of its hitbox, a boat with chest can be placed above up to 9 hoppers, allowing it to evenly split its items nine ways.\nPiglin[edit | edit source]\nAs with other chests, opening or breaking a boat with chest causes nearby piglin(s) to attack the player.\nSounds[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition:\nBoats with chests use the Friendly Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n[hide]\nSounds\nSound Subtitles Source Description Resource location Translation key Volume Pitch Attenuation\ndistance\nRowing Friendly Creatures While a boat with chest is rowed on land entity.boat.paddle_land subtitles.entity.boat.paddle_land 1.0 0.8-1.2 16\nRowing Friendly Creatures While a boat with chest is rowed in water entity.boat.paddle_water subtitles.entity.boat.paddle_water 0.8 0.8-1.2 16\nBedrock Edition:\n[hide]\nSounds\nSound Source Description Resource location Volume Pitch\nPlayers While a boat with chest is rowed in water random.swim ? 0.6-1.4\nData values[edit | edit source]\nID[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition:\nName Identifier Form Item tags\n[hide]\nTranslation key\nOak Boat with Chest oak_chest_boat Item boats\nchest_boats\nitem.minecraft.oak_chest_boat\nSpruce Boat with Chest spruce_chest_boat Item boats\nchest_boats\nitem.minecraft.spruce_chest_boat\nBirch Boat with Chest birch_chest_boat Item boats\nchest_boats\nitem.minecraft.birch_chest_boat\nJungle Boat with Chest jungle_chest_boat Item boats\nchest_boats\nitem.minecraft.jungle_chest_boat\nAcacia Boat with Chest acacia_chest_boat Item boats\nchest_boats\nitem.minecraft.acacia_chest_boat\nDark Oak Boat with Chest dark_oak_chest_boat Item boats\nchest_boats\nitem.minecraft.dark_oak_chest_boat\nMangrove Boat with Chest mangrove_chest_boat Item boats\nchest_boats\nitem.minecraft.mangrove_chest_boat\nCherry Boat with Chest cherry_chest_boat Item boats\nchest_boats\nitem.minecraft.cherry_chest_boat\nPale Oak Boat with Chest pale_oak_chest_boat Item boats\nchest_boats\nitem.minecraft.pale_oak_chest_boat\nBamboo Raft with Chest bamboo_chest_raft Item boats\nchest_boats\nitem.minecraft.bamboo_chest_raft\nName\n[hide]\nIdentifier\nOak Boat with Chest oak_chest_boat\nSpruce Boat with Chest spruce_chest_boat\nBirch Boat with Chest birch_chest_boat\nJungle Boat with Chest jungle_chest_boat\nAcacia Boat with Chest acacia_chest_boat\nDark Oak Boat with Chest dark_oak_chest_boat\nMangrove Boat with Chest mangrove_chest_boat\nCherry Boat with Chest cherry_chest_boat\nPale Oak Boat with Chest pale_oak_chest_boat\nBamboo Raft with Chest bamboo_chest_raft\nBedrock Edition:\nName Identifier Alias ID Numeric ID Form Item tags\n[hide]\nTranslation key\nOak Boat with Chest oak_chest_boat chest_boat / 0 646 Item minecraft:boats\nitem.chest_boat.oak.name\nSpruce Boat with Chest spruce_chest_boat chest_boat / 1 649 Item minecraft:boats\nitem.chest_boat.spruce.name\nBirch Boat with Chest birch_chest_boat chest_boat / 2 647 Item minecraft:boats\nitem.chest_boat.birch.name\nJungle Boat with Chest jungle_chest_boat chest_boat / 3 648 Item minecraft:boats\nitem.chest_boat.jungle.name\nAcacia Boat with Chest acacia_chest_boat chest_boat / 4 650 Item minecraft:boats\nitem.chest_boat.acacia.name\nDark Oak Boat with Chest dark_oak_chest_boat chest_boat / 5 651 Item minecraft:boats\nitem.chest_boat.big_oak.name\nMangrove Boat with Chest mangrove_chest_boat chest_boat / 6 652 Item minecraft:boats\nitem.chest_boat.mangrove.name\nCherry Boat with Chest cherry_chest_boat chest_boat / 8 658 Item minecraft:boats\nitem.chest_boat.cherry.name\nPale Oak Boat with Chest pale_oak_chest_boat chest_boat / 9 723 Item minecraft:boats\nitem.chest_boat.pale_oak.name\nBamboo Raft with Chest bamboo_chest_raft chest_boat / 7 662 Item minecraft:boats\nitem.chest_boat.bamboo.name\nEntity Identifier Numeric ID\n[hide]\nTranslation key\nBoat with Chest chest_boat 218\nentity.chest_boat.name\nEntity data[edit | edit source]\nBoat with chests have entity data associated with them that contain various properties of the entity.\nJava Edition:\nMain article: Entity format\n[NBT Compound / JSON Object] Entity data\nTags common to all boats[show]\nTags common to all container entities[show]\nTags common to all entities[show]\nBoat Type[show][edit]\nBedrock Edition:\nSee Bedrock Edition level format/Entity format.\nAchievements[edit | edit source]\n[hide]\nIcon Achievement In-game description Actual requirements (if different) Gamerscore earned Trophy type (PS)\nPS4 Other\nFreight Station Use a Hopper to move an item from a Chest Minecart to a Chest.

Bone meal affects only the stem's growth; it does not cause melons or pumpkins to sprout from a mature stem.\nSaplings\nAzalea\nFlowering Azalea\nMangrove Propagule (not hanging) The sapling has a 45% chance of growing to the next growth stage, if possible. Saplings have two growth stages (with no visible difference between them) before growing into trees as the third stage. A tree cannot grow unless the sapling is planted in proper ground and sufficient space is available. Using bone meal on such an obstructed sapling with no chance of growing wastes the bone meal.\nSunflower\nLilac\nRose Bush\nPeony The corresponding item form drops, without destroying the original plant.\nShort Grass\nFern\nSeagrass A one-block-high tall short grass, fern, or seagrass (that is on grass block, dirt, coarse dirt, rooted dirt, farmland, podzol, mycelium, moss block, mud, or muddy mangrove roots) grows into a two-block-high tall grass, large fern, or tall seagrass.\nMushrooms Has a 40% chance of growing into a huge mushroom if on grass block, dirt, coarse dirt, rooted dirt, farmland, podzol, mycelium, moss block, mud, or muddy mangrove roots.\nCocoa The cocoa plant matures 1 growth stage.\nSweet Berry Bush The bush matures 1 growth stage.\nSea Pickle If the sea pickle is on a coral block and in water at least 2 blocks deep, the sea pickle colony grows, and additional sea pickles generate nearby.\nSugar Cane‌[BE only] The sugar cane grows to maximum height (three blocks tall).\nKelp The kelp plant grows by 1 block per bone meal used, up to its maximum height.\nFlower (excluding wither rose and torchflower)‌[BE only] One-block-high flowers make more flowers of the same type grow in the surrounding area.\nFungus Grows into huge fungi, but only if on the respective nylium.\nWeeping Vines Grows the weeping vines a few blocks downward.\nTwisting Vines Grows the twisting vines a few blocks upward.\nCave Vines Produces glow berries if the vine did not have any glow berries on it already.\nGlow Lichen The glow lichen spreads to a random adjacent block.\nMoss Block The moss block causes nearby stone, cave vines, and dirt to become moss blocks.\nPale Moss Block The pale moss block causes nearby stone, cave vines, and dirt to become pale moss blocks, and turns into a pale moss patch.\nBig Dripleaf\nSmall Dripleaf A big dripleaf grows one block higher, and a small dripleaf becomes a big dripleaf.\nRooted Dirt Causes hanging roots to grow underneath the rooted dirt if there is space.\nMangrove Leaves Creates a hanging mangrove propagule under the mangrove leaves.\nMangrove Propagule (hanging) The mangrove propagule matures 1 growth age.\nPink Petals Produces another pink petal in the block. If there are already four pink petals in the block, it drops a pink petal as an item.\nTorchflower Crop\nPitcher Crop Grows every stage.\nTall Dry Grass Places a short dry grass on a neighboring block if possible.\nShort Dry Grass Grows into tall dry grass.\nBone meal does not affect:\nCactus\nVines\nNether wart\nSugar cane‌[Java Edition only]\nChorus plants, or other plants not listed above.\nWasting bone meal[edit | edit source]\nBone meal can be used on the following objects in the following situations, consuming it without any real effect:\nOn short grass, ferns, and seagrass that do not have enough space to grow.[1]\nOn seagrass that doesn't have water above.\nOn a dark oak sapling that is not in a group of four.[2]\nOn a mushroom that is not on a block that allows it to grow into a huge mushroom.[3]\nOn a sea pickle that is already in a group of four and has no valid locations to expand to.[4]\nOn a sea pickle that is not on a coral block.\nOn a bamboo (not bamboo shoot) that is blocked in the way.\nOn a fungus that is not on its respective nylium.\nAny plants whose growth is blocked by the build limit.\nCreating new plants[edit | edit source]\nUsing bone meal on a grass block causes foliage to sprout on and around the targeted block. Grass blocks within a 15×5×15‌[JE only] or 7×5×7‌[BE only] area of the target block randomly chooses which type of foliage to grow, if any (provided there is adequate space for the plant to grow). The types of foliage that can be created in this way are short grass, fern‌[BE only], tall grass‌[JE only], flowers, and pink petals, with the latter two being dependent on external factors like the biome and coordinates. See Flower § Flower biomes and Flower § Post-generation for more information.\nUsing bone meal on a 2-block flower (rose bushes, sunflowers, lilacs or peonies) cause one of the same type of flower to drop, without breaking the original. This is the only way to reproduce these flowers, since they cannot generate from using bone meal on grass blocks.\nUsing bone meal on a non-transparent block that is underwater generates seagrass on that block and surrounding blocks. In Java Edition, coral and coral fans may have a chance to generate in warm ocean biomes; in Bedrock Edition, coral and coral fans can be generated in any biome. In Bedrock Edition, in order to successfully use bone meal underwater, there must be 2 water blocks above the block the bone meal is being used on, and the lower one must be non-flowing water.\nUsing bone meal on a sea pickle on a coral block creates sea pickles. This generates sea pickles up to 3 blocks (of coral) away, so a 7 × 7 square (49 blocks) of coral may be necessary, to return the most sea pickles per given bone meal attempt (more attempts grows them more numerously, exactly - including the range of it growing, like grass with heights on grass blocks - as coral and coral fans, though those others being non-solid blocks).\nUsing bone meal on netherrack adjacent to nylium converts the netherrack into nylium of the same type. If both crimson and warped nylium are adjacent to the netherrack that was applied with bone meal, there is a 50% chance that either type of nylium is created.\nUsing bone meal on nylium causes the corresponding nether roots and both types of fungi to appear on the nylium block and other nylium, netherrack, dirt or grass blocks nearby (in a 5 × 5 total area), with the type of fungi matching the type of nylium being more common. In addition, using bone meal on warped nylium creates nether sprouts and twisting vines.\nFarmer villagers[edit | edit source]\nVillagers with the farmer profession can collect bone meal from a full composter, with which they can make their crops grow faster.\nSounds[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition:\n[hide]\nSounds\nSound Subtitles Source Description Resource location Translation key Volume Pitch Attenuation\ndistance\nBone Meal crinkles Blocks When bone meal is successfully used item.bone_meal.use subtitles.item.bone_meal.use 1.0 1.0 16\nBedrock Edition:\n[hide]\nSounds\nSound Source Description Resource location Volume Pitch\nBlocks When bone meal is successfully used item.bone_meal.use 1.0 0.9-1.1\nData values[edit | edit source]\nID[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition:\nName Identifier Form\n[hide]\nTranslation key\nBone Meal bone_meal Item\nitem.minecraft.bone_meal\nBedrock Edition:\nName Identifier Alias ID Numeric ID Form\n[hide]\nTranslation key\nBone Meal bone_meal dye / 15 411 Item\nitem.dye.white.name\nHistory[edit | edit source]\n[hide]\nJava Edition Beta\n1.2 Added bone meal.\nBone meal can now be applied only to saplings and wheat.\n1.6.6 Bone meal can now be applied on grass blocks.\n1.8 Pre-release Bone meal can now be used on mushrooms to make huge mushrooms, and the block the mushroom is on changes to dirt.\nPre-release 2 ;) Bone meal can now be applied on pumpkin and melon seeds.\n[hide]\nJava Edition\n1.3.1 12w19a Bone meal can now be applied on cocoa beans.\n1.3 The texture of bone meal has been changed.\n1.4.2 12w34a Bone meal can now be used to dye leather armor and tamed wolf's collar.\n1.4.6 12w49a Bone meal can now be crafted with gunpowder to create a firework star.\n1.5 13w04a Bone meal has been significantly nerfed.\nWheat, melon and pumpkin seeds, potatoes and carrots: one bone meal is now consumed for all seven stages of growth (melon and pumpkin seeds do not spawn right away).\nSaplings: one bone meal is now consumed for each of the two growth stages, then it grows into a tree.\nCocoas: one bone meal is now consumed for each of the three stages of growth.\nGreen particles are now displayed when bone meal is used.\nBone meal can now be used from dispensers.\n13w05a The balancing of bone meal has been adjusted.

However, the paste does not work if the text being pasted is longer than a single page. Most Unicode characters are available in books, and they may be pasted in without issue.\nIn singleplayer, the world pauses while a book is being edited.‌[Java Edition only]\nThe book writing interface must be closed by pressing the Done button. Any other way of closing it (such as by pressing the Escape key) causes all work from the session to be lost.\nLecterns[edit | edit source]\nA book and quill (as well as a written book) can be placed on an empty lectern.\nThe lectern then emits a redstone signal depending on the displayed page in the book. On the last page, the lectern emits a signal strength of 15. This is why lecterns are listed in the \"redstone\" tab in the creative inventory.\nFormatting codes[edit | edit source]\nMain article: Formatting codes\nText in a book can be styled using codes starting with the § character (section sign).\n§k creates randomly changing characters.\n§l creates bold text.\n§m creates strikethrough text.‌[JE only]\n§n creates underlined text.‌[JE only]\n§o creates italic text.\n§0 – f (hexadecimal) creates colored text.\n§r resets any of the previous styles so text after it appears normally.\nIf the player uses multiple codes, and continue typing past the end of a line, the next line exhibits only the last formatting code used.\nSigning[edit | edit source]\nBooks can be signed by pressing the \"Sign\" button while in the interface. In Java Edition, when signed, a book bears the name of the player who wrote it and a title chosen upon signing. In Bedrock Edition, the book doesn't display the name of the player as the author; instead, the author can be any text the player wants. After it has been signed, it cannot be edited again – it has turned into a written book.\nSpecial characters can be used in the title, if typed from a keyboard that supports them. Alt codes do not work, and the § character cannot be typed even using a keyboard that implements it, meaning titles cannot be colored or formatted in-game. However, on Linux using the compose key to produce special characters does work.\nThe title of the book can be up to 15 characters long[1], and the player cannot paste into a title. If a custom name is removed from a written book, it reverts back to the title it was given during the signing process.\nChiseled bookshelf[edit | edit source]\nUsing the chiseled bookshelf while having a book and quill in the main hand puts the book inside the chiseled bookshelf.\nTrading[edit | edit source]\nVillager Probability Villager wants Player receives\nJE BE\nExpert Librarian 50% 100% Book and Quill\n+ Book and Quill[t 1] Emerald\n↑ In Java Edition only one is requested per trade because of MC-248042 — Librarian's book and quill trade is always discounted to 1 since books are unstackable. In Bedrock Edition, the second book is placed in another slot instead.\nInserting screenshots[edit | edit source]\nThis feature is exclusive to Minecraft Education. \nScreenshots in the portfolio can be inserted into book and quill.[2] This can be done by clicking the pencil button on the bottom of the page, and clicking the photo button (shown as an icon that looks like photo with a plus next to it).\nThe photo button brings up the portfolio menu, where players can select which screenshot to be inserted into the book and quill page. Each screenshot takes up one page.\nPlayers can export their books and quills photos and written texts as a PDF file.

Each defense point reduces any damage dealt to the player that is absorbed by armor by 4%, increasing additively with the number of defense points.

Damage taken that armor doesn't protect (such as falling or drowning) does not damage the armor, even if it is enchanted to protect against that type of damage.

Using one on a transformed player (or drinking it) removes the transformation and convert the bottle into a bottle of entity of that transformation, or a bottle of the players active effects if they were not transformed.\nA transformation into an entity sometimes leads to special effects. For example, transforming into a chicken allows the player to glide slowly to the ground. The chicken, however, takes fall damage upon landing, killing it and transforming the player back to themselves.\nTransforming into an enderman causes the player to be teleported randomly when a projectile is aimed at it or when they're being looked at by other players. Transforming into any mob capable of flight (for example, a bat) allows the player to fly in survival mode as if they were in creative mode. The Bottle of Entity is heavily based off of the famous Morph Mod.\nContents\n1 Obtaining\n2 Sounds\n3 Data values\n3.1 ID\n4 Issues\n5 Navigation\nObtaining[edit | edit source]\nBottle of void is obtained by drinking a glass bottle.

The enchantments are never treasure enchantments.\nFishing[edit | edit source]\nMain article: Fishing\nEnchanted bows are obtainable through fishing, with a 0.8% chance per attempt. See fishing for more details. When caught, the bow may be damaged and contain random enchantments equivalent to a level 30 enchantment from an enchanting table, including treasure enchantments like Mending.\nUsage[edit | edit source]\nWeapon[edit | edit source]\nBows can be drawn back by using them. In order to use a bow, the player must have at least one arrow in their inventory or be in Creative mode. The arrow that is shown inside the bow always looks like a regular arrow, regardless of what kind of arrow is actually being shot from the bow.[1]\nWhen drawing a bow, the display zooms in slightly. Charging the bow to its maximum causes it to visually shake as an indicator. Releasing the button shoots an arrow. Drawing a bow can be canceled by switching to another hotbar slot while holding use. Holding the bow at maximum charge for more than 72000 ticks (1 hour) results in the charge being reset without shooting an arrow.\nWhile the bow is being charged or remains fully charged, the player is forced to move at sneaking speed, unless they are riding a horse, minecart or boat, or flying with elytra. It is not possible to sprint while charging a bow or holding a drawn bow. When the bow is released, normal motion resumes although any prior sprint is cancelled. Sneaking while drawing the bow makes the player move even slower.\nIf an arrow hits another player, the player that shoots the arrow hears a high-pitched \"ding\" sound.‌[Java Edition only]\nFully charged shots launch critical arrows that have a trail of particles behind them and deal up to\n(\n3\nx\n2\n)\n+\n2\ndamage, where\nx\nis the damage after any enchantments. The listed values below describe maximum damage from a bow with no Power enchantments, assuming the target is at a distance where drag and gravity are negligible. The average damage of a shot at critical charge is around 9, as damage is dealt at a random value between\nx\nand\n(\n3\nx\n2\n)\n+\n2\nand it is rare to have minimum or maximum values. The damage dealt can ultimately be less than the maximum damage if the arrow slows down after being shot.\nCharging time Attack damage\n0.1 s (no charge) 1HP\n0.2–0.9 s (medium charge) 5HP\n1 s (full charge) 6HP\nAbove 1 s (critical charge) 6HP to 11HP × 5.5\nThe game stores the damage of arrows even in values with a decimal point. For example, it is possible for a critical arrow shot to cause damage values such as 6.4. In this case, the game can round up or down and store the amount for subsequent damage sources.\nAny projectile thrown by the player is under the influence of momentum in current versions of Minecraft. Naturally, the player's movement speed can be modified under a number of circumstances, affecting the ballistic trajectory of projectiles, and as a result, the damage inflicted by arrows.\nIn Java Edition Combat Tests, to avoid sniping, arrows shot from fully-charged bows become non-critical if held drawn back for longer than three seconds. Instantaneous effects on tipped arrows are scaled by 1/8, just like the duration of other effects. For example, Instant Damage I arrow deals an additional 0.75HP × 0.375 magical damage.\nDamage caused by the arrow is not affected by the Strength effect.\nFew mobs cannot be shot using an arrow, because the arrow either disappears or it gets deflected. This includes:\nEndermen - even while immobile, the enderman is immune to damage from arrows;\nBreeze;\nWither under half health, when it gains wither armor;\nClosed shulkers;\nEnder dragon, while sitting on top of the exit portal.\nAlso, a shield can block any attack from the bow.\nCrafting ingredient[edit | edit source]\nName Ingredients Crafting recipe\n[hide]\nDescription\nDispenser Cobblestone +\nBow +\nRedstone Dust\n\nThe bow can be of any durability.\nEnchantments on the bow do not affect the resulting dispenser.\nRepairing[edit | edit source]\nCombining[edit | edit source]\nIngredients Crafting recipe\n[hide]\nDescription\n2× Damaged Bow\n\n\nThe durability of the two bows is added together, plus an extra 5% durability.\nIngredients Grinding recipe\n[hide]\nDescription\n2× Damaged Bow\nThe durability of the two bows is added together, plus an extra 5% durability.\nUnit repair[edit | edit source]\nMain article: Anvil mechanics § Unit repair\nIngredients\n[hide]\nAnvil recipe\nDamaged Bow\nBow\nA bow can be combined with another bow in an anvil, preserving the enchantments of both.\nEnchantments[edit | edit source]\nBows can receive several different enchantments and have a base enchantability of 1.

Its vertical speed is modified by one block downward every second, resulting in a parabolic flight path. An arrow slows down if shot through water, reducing its damage to near zero unless brought back into the air or otherwise given momentum.‌[Java Edition only]\nArrows that hit solid blocks become stuck and can be retrieved, unless the arrow was shot by a bow enchanted with Infinity, a player in Creative mode, or a mob.\nAn arrow shot through lava ignites, giving it the effect of the Flame enchantment, igniting any entity it hits. If not extinguished, the fire inflicts up to 4HP damage. Although a wither skeleton does not spawn naturally with a bow, it shoots flaming arrows if given a bow using commands.\nOn impact, an arrow can trigger a wooden pressure plate, target block, wooden button, or tripwire. Arrows cannot trigger stone pressure plates or stone buttons.\nThe player can choose the type of arrow to shoot based on its location in the inventory. Arrows in the off-hand, or the selected hotbar slot if the bow is in the off-hand, are prioritized first. If there are no arrows in the off-hand or selected hotbar slot then the arrow closest to slot 0 is selected.\nSounds[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition\n[hide]\nSounds\nSound Subtitles Source Description Resource location Translation key Volume Pitch Attenuation\ndistance\nArrow hits Friendly Creatures When an arrow impacts something entity.arrow.hit subtitles.entity.arrow.hit 1.0 12⁄11-4⁄3 16\nArrow fired Players When a bow shoots an arrow entity.arrow.shoot subtitles.entity.arrow.shoot 1.0 4⁄3-1.125 [sound 1] 16\nPlayer hit Players When an arrow shot by a player hits another player entity.arrow.hit_player subtitles.entity.arrow.hit_player 0.18 0.45 16\nItem breaks Players When a bow's durability is exhausted entity.item.break subtitles.entity.item.break 0.8 0.8-1.2 16\n↑ Depends on how long the bow has been charging. uncharged bows give 5⁄6-0.625\nBedrock Edition:\n[hide]\nSounds\nSound Source Description Resource location Volume Pitch\nPlayers When an arrow impacts something random.bowhit 1.0 1.09-1.3\nPlayers When a bow shoots an arrow random.bow 1.0 0.83-1.25\nPlayers When a bow's durability is exhausted random.break 1.0 0.9\nData values[edit | edit source]\nID[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition:\nName Identifier Form\n[hide]\nTranslation key\nBow bow Item\nitem.minecraft.bow\nBedrock Edition:\nName Identifier Numeric ID Form\n[hide]\nTranslation key\nBow bow 300 Item\nitem.bow.name\nAchievements[edit | edit source]\n[hide]\nIcon Achievement In-game description Actual requirements (if different) Gamerscore earned Trophy type (PS)\nPS4 Other\nArcher Kill a creeper with arrows. — 10 Bronze\nBullseye Hit the bullseye of a Target block — 15 Bronze\nDispense With This Construct a Dispenser. — 20 Bronze\nSniper Duel Kill a Skeleton with an arrow from more than 50 meters.

To use it, select the bow from your inventory and make sure you’ve got some arrows. Click in front of you, and an arrow goes flying using real physics. To actually HIT something, aim above it.\"\n0.24 SURVIVAL TEST The player did not need a bow to shoot arrows. Instead, Tab was used to fire arrows. However, arrows still had to be collected to shoot. Launching arrows this way was much slower than the bow that now fires them.\n[hide]\nJava Edition Indev\n0.31 20100110 Added bow texture to items.png.\n20100122 Added bows as item with changed texture. The right mouse button can be held down to fire in rapid succession. Each arrow deals 4HP for each hit. They fly in a ballistic trajectory affected by gravity and drag in air or water. They travel approximately 15 blocks when fired parallel to a flat plane. Arrows also have a maximum range of around 52 blocks when fired at a 38 degree angle on a flat plane.\nBows often fail to interact with objects, but instead shoot. This is due to the fact that shooting arrows is an instantaneous action.\nAt this point, bows have no durability, and can essentially be used infinitely.\n[hide]\nJava Edition Alpha\nv1.2.6 Interacting with objects (door, chest, etc.) while holding a bow no longer shoots the arrow.\n[hide]\nJava Edition Beta\n1.2 Bows are now used to craft dispensers.\n1.8 July 8, 2011 Notch teased hold-to-charge bows.\nJuly 13, 2011 Notch indicated that along with bow charging, he would add an achievement based around shooting a skeleton at 50 meters, eventually to be known as Sniper duel.\nPre-release Bow behavior has been overhauled; they now need to be charged to fire.\n[hide]\nJava Edition\n1.0.0 RC1 A fully charged arrow from a bow now consistently deals 9HP damage, with a rare chance of dealing 10HP.\nBows now have a durability of 385 uses.\nBows no longer need arrows for ammo in Creative mode.\nThe bow can now be enchanted via console commands, but no enchantment affects it.\n1.1 release Bows can now be legitimately enchanted.

Likewise, throwing brown eggs at neutral mobs provokes them. Brown eggs can also be fired from dispensers and are affected by gravity. Brown eggs thrown through fire or lava in Bedrock Edition catch fire, and set fire to entities they hit.\nSpawning chickens[edit | edit source]\nWhen thrown by a dispenser or by pressing the use button, a brown egg has a 1⁄8 (12.5%) chance of spawning a warm chick. If this occurs, there is a 1⁄32 (3.125%) chance of spawning three additional warm chicks (on average, 1 out of every 256 brown eggs spawns 4 chicks). In other words, whenever a brown egg is thrown, there is a 31⁄256 chance of spawning 1 warm chick and a 1⁄256 chance of spawning four warm chicks.\nThe expected value of the number of warm chicks a brown egg produces is 35⁄256 or 13.7%. This means that on average, a warm chick is spawned every 7.3 brown eggs, a stack of 16 brown eggs spawns 2.188 warm chicks, and a full inventory including the hotbar and off-hand (37 × 16 = 592 brown eggs) is expected to spawn approximately 81 warm chicks.\nFor the purposes of establishing a new warm chicken farm with brown eggs alone, the probability P for at least 2 warm chicks to spawn after throwing n warm eggs can be calculated using the following formula:\nP\n=\n1\n−\n(\n7\n8\n)\nn\n−\nn\n×\n1\n8\n×\n3\n1\n3\n2\n×\n(\n7\n8\n)\nn\n−\n1\nWhen throwing 16 brown eggs, there is a 62% chance of spawning at least two warm chicks. When throwing 32 brown eggs, the probability rises to 92%\nAn average of 450 seconds elapses for a warm chicken to lay another brown egg. Accounting for all probabilities, the average warm chicken produces 1.09 warm chickens per hour when all the brown eggs it lays are thrown.\nSounds[edit | edit source]\n[hide]\nSounds\nSound Subtitles Source Description Resource location Translation key Volume Pitch Attenuation\ndistance\nEgg flies Players When an egg is thrown entity.egg.throw subtitles.entity.egg.throw 0.5 1⁄3-0.5 16\nDispensed item Blocks When a dispenser shoots an egg block.dispenser.launch subtitles.block.dispenser.dispense 1.0 1.2 16\nChicken plops Friendly Creatures When an egg is laid by a chicken entity.chicken.egg subtitles.entity.chicken.egg 1.0 0.8-1.2 16\nData values[edit | edit source]\nID[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition:\nName Identifier Form\n[hide]\nTranslation key\nBrown Egg brown_egg Item\nitem.minecraft.brown_egg\nName Identifier Entity tags\n[hide]\nTranslation key\nThrown Egg egg impact_projectiles\nentity.minecraft.egg\nBedrock Edition:\nName Identifier Numeric ID Form\n[hide]\nTranslation key\nBrown Egg brown_egg 750 Item\nitem.brown_egg.name\nEntity data[edit | edit source]\nThrown eggs have entity data that define various properties of the entity.\nJava Edition:\nMain article: Entity format\n[NBT Compound / JSON Object] Entity data\nTags common to all entities[show]\nTags common to all projectiles[show]\n[NBT Compound / JSON Object] Item: The item to render as, may be absent.\nTags common to all items[show]\nHistory[edit | edit source]\n[hide]\nUpcoming Java Edition\n1.21.5 25w06a Added brown eggs.\n[hide]\nUpcoming Bedrock Edition\n1.21.70\nExperiment\nDrop 1 2025 Preview 1.21.70.22 Added brown eggs.\n1.21.70 Preview 1.21.70.23 All features behind the \"Drop 1 2025\" experimental toggle have now been fully implemented.\nIssues[edit | edit source]\nIssues relating to \"Brown Egg\" are maintained on the bug tracker.

If the empty bucket is part of a stack and the player's inventory is full, the filled bucket drops in front of the player as an item.\nA bucket filled with a source block can then be used to place its source block contents in the empty block next to the side of the block the player is currently looking at, or replacing the block looked at for some replaceable blocks.\nOne can press use when looking at a cow, mooshroom, or goat to fill a bucket with milk. A bucket full of milk can be emptied only by drinking it or by using it to crafting a cake.\nA bucket full of water can be used on a live aquatic mob (cod, salmon, tropical fish, pufferfish, axolotl, or tadpole) to collect the mob in the bucket for transportation to another location. The mob in item form becomes a bucket of aquatic mob.\nAn empty bucket can be used to empty a cauldron with water or lava, filling the bucket with the fluid. This does not work with dispensers[1].\nA lava bucket placed in the fuel slot of a furnace becomes an empty bucket after the lava is consumed during smelting.\nAn empty bucket fills with water when placed in the fuel slot of a furnace while smelting a wet sponge.\nAn empty bucket can be used to collect powder snow, filling the bucket with powder snow.

Once a water bucket is used, the mob is picked up along with the water source block. The mob bucket obtained corresponds to the mob picked up.\nUsage[edit | edit source]\nPressing use with a bucket of aquatic mob places a water source block, and spawns the mob back into the world, leaving an empty bucket in the player's inventory. For buckets of tropical fish, the fish and its details (color, size, name) are kept. Placing a bucket of aquatic mob in the Nether causes the same particles to appear that generate when a normal water bucket is placed in the Nether, and the fish is spawned alone.\nMobs caught in buckets then released do not despawn, unlike mobs that spawn naturally in their aquatic environments.\nIf a bucket of aquatic mob is inside a dispenser, the dispenser spawns the mob and water block in front of it upon activation, leaving an empty bucket inside.

Items that stack to less than 64 occupy more space within the bundle, and items that do not stack occupy the entire bundle without allowing space for any other items.\nDyed bundles are the dyed variants of bundles.\nContents\n1 Obtaining\n1.1 Crafting\n1.2 Generated loot\n2 Usage\n2.1 Inserting and retrieving\n2.2 GUI\n3 Sounds\n4 Data values\n4.1 ID\n4.2 Item data\n5 Videos\n6 History\n7 Issues\n8 Trivia\n9 Gallery\n9.1 Mojang screenshots\n9.2 In other media\n10 References\n11 Navigation\nObtaining[edit | edit source]\nCrafting[edit | edit source]\nIngredients\n[hide]\nCrafting recipe\nString +\nLeather\n\nIngredients\n[hide]\nCrafting recipe\nAny Bundle +\nMatching Dye\n\n\nGenerated loot[edit | edit source]\nThis section is missing information about: Loot info for containers in cartographer, weaponsmith, toolsmith, plains house, desert house, snowy house, savanna house, and taiga house buildings. \nPlease expand the section to include this information. Further details may exist on the talk page.\nBundles also can be found in some of the chests in villages.\n[upcoming JE 1.21.5 & BE 1.21.70]\nItem Structure Container Quantity Chance\nBundle\nVillage Plains\nVillage Desert\nVillage Savanna\nVillage Taiga\nVillage Snowy\nTanner's chest 1 33%\nUsage[edit | edit source]\n64\n16\n\n4\n64\n\nItem stack sizes (top row) and the number of bundle slots they take up (middle row). Sticks stack to 64, so they take up one bundle slot; ender pearls stack to 16, so they take up four; and swords do not stack, so they take up the whole bundle. So, for instance, a bundle may have 32 sticks and 8 ender pearls inside, which take up a total of (32×1)+(8×4)=64 bundle slots.\nBundles are used to store different item types in the same inventory slot. This does not, however, increase the total capacity of the slot, as bundles can only store what adds up to a single slot. Items that can normally stack up to 64 take up 1/64 of a bundle, items that can normally stack up to 16 (eg. eggs) take up 1/16 of a bundle, and items that can't stack take up the entirety of a bundle (with exception to bundles themselves). On Java Edition, space that an item takes up in a bundle is equal to the reciprocal of its max_stack_size component, even if it is different from the standard 1, 16, and 64.\nBundles are not stackable, but they are able to be placed (nested) inside another[1], and will always take up 1/16 of the space of a bundle, regardless of their max_stack_size component, plus the space occupied by the inner bundle's contents.\nShulker boxes cannot be placed inside of bundles. However, bundles can be placed inside of shulker boxes.\nInserting and retrieving[edit | edit source]\nItems are inserted into bundles by left-clicking, and retrieved by right-clicking.\nTo place items inside a bundle, either (1) pick up the bundle in the inventory and left-click on the item(s) to be placed inside or (2) pick up the item(s) and left-click on the bundle. When placing a bundle inside another bundle, the interface uses the first method: picking up bundle A and right clicking on bundle B attempts to store bundle B inside A.\nItems can be retrieved from bundles in one of five ways:\nRight-clicking on bundles in an inventory, without holding anything with the cursor, will cause the cursor to hold the item from the most recently added slot of the bundle.\nScrolling on bundles in an inventory allows for scrolling through the bundle's slots, which starts off as the most recently added slot, and is displayed with a bright underlay behind that slot. During this process, the bundle's icon will appear open, and the selected slot's item icon will appear within the bundle's icon, though this is not shown in the player's hand. If the bundle is right-clicked while in this state, the currently selected item will move to the cursor and the bundle will close. If the cursor is moved off the bundle while it's still open, the bundle will close.\nRight-clicking on bundles in an inventory while they are held in the cursor and are hovering over an empty slot where can be placed will cause that item to be placed in that slot.\nUsing a bundle while it is selected in the hotbar will cause the contents of the most recently added slot to be thrown out in the direction the player is facing.\nWhen a bundle item entity is destroyed, the contents of the bundle are dropped as items, similar to when a shulker box is destroyed.\nGUI[edit | edit source]\nHovering over a quarter-full bundle with 16 items.\nHovering over a bundle reveals its blue fullness bar. When the bundle is empty, the fullness bar says \"Empty\" and shows the description, \"Can hold a mixed stack of items\". If it's completely full, the fullness bar turns red and says \"Full\". When there is at least one item in a bundle, space will open up above the bar, which displays the items in the bundle's slots, sorted by how recently they were added, from right to left. The space where the slots are shown is only wide enough for four slots, so additional space opens up for new rows. When there are more than three rows, only the top three will be displayed, and the bottom-right slot will be replaced by text that says, +<number of slots hidden>, where the slot replaced by the text counts toward that number.\nBundles show an additional fullness bar on their icons, in a similar way to how items that take damage show their durability. Bundle fullness bars are blue, or red when full, and appear when the bundle contains at least one item.\nSounds[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition:\n[hide]\nv t e\nSounds\nSound Subtitles Source Description Resource location Translation key Volume Pitch Attenuation\ndistance\nBundle empties Players When a bundle's items are thrown onto the ground item.bundle.drop_contents subtitles.item.bundle.drop_contents 0.8 varies [sound 1] 16\nItem packed Players When items are placed into a bundle item.bundle.insert subtitles.item.bundle.insert 0.8 varies [sound 2] 16\nBundle full Players When items cannot be placed into a bundle item.bundle.insert_fail subtitles.item.bundle.insert_fail 1.0 1.0 16\nItem unpacked Players When items are removed from a bundle item.bundle.remove_one subtitles.item.bundle.remove_one 0.8 varies [sound 3] 16\n↑ Can be 0.8-1.2 or 0.76-1.14 for each sound\n↑ Can be 0.8-1.2, 0.76-1.14, or 0.84-1.26 for each sound\n↑ Can be 0.8-1.2, 0.84-1.26, or 0.88-1.32 for each sound\nBedrock Edition:\n[hide]\nv t e\nSounds\nSound Source Description Resource location Volume Pitch\nPlayers When a bundle's items are thrown onto the ground bundle.drop_contents 1.0 varies[sound 1]\nPlayers When items are placed into a bundle bundle.insert 1.0 varies[sound 2]\nPlayers When items cannot be placed into a bundle bundle.insert_fail 1.0 1.0\nPlayers When items are removed from a bundle bundle.remove_one 1.0 varies[sound 3]\n↑ Can be 1.0 or 0.95 for each sound\n↑ Can be 1.0, 1.05, or 0.95 for each sound\n↑ Can be 1.0, 1.05, or 1.1\nData values[edit | edit source]\nID[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition:\nName Identifier Form Item tags\n[hide]\nTranslation key\nBundle bundle Item bundles\nitem.minecraft.bundle\nWhite Bundle white_bundle Item bundles\nitem.minecraft.white_bundle\nOrange Bundle orange_bundle Item bundles\nitem.minecraft.orange_bundle\nMagenta Bundle magenta_bundle Item bundles\nitem.minecraft.magenta_bundle\nLight Blue Bundle light_blue_bundle Item bundles\nitem.minecraft.light_blue_bundle\nYellow Bundle yellow_bundle Item bundles\nitem.minecraft.yellow_bundle\nLime Bundle lime_bundle Item bundles\nitem.minecraft.lime_bundle\nPink Bundle pink_bundle Item bundles\nitem.minecraft.pink_bundle\nGray Bundle gray_bundle Item bundles\nitem.minecraft.gray_bundle\nLight Gray Bundle light_gray_bundle Item bundles\nitem.minecraft.light_gray_bundle\nCyan Bundle cyan_bundle Item bundles\nitem.minecraft.cyan_bundle\nPurple Bundle purple_bundle Item bundles\nitem.minecraft.purple_bundle\nBlue Bundle blue_bundle Item bundles\nitem.minecraft.blue_bundle\nBrown Bundle brown_bundle Item bundles\nitem.minecraft.brown_bundle\nGreen Bundle green_bundle Item bundles\nitem.minecraft.green_bundle\nRed Bundle red_bundle Item bundles\nitem.minecraft.red_bundle\nBlack Bundle black_bundle Item bundles\nitem.minecraft.black_bundle\nBedrock Edition:\nName Identifier Numeric ID Form\n[hide]\nTranslation key\nBundle bundle 260 Item\nitem.bundle\nWhite Bundle white_bundle 272 Item\nitem.white_bundle\nOrange Bundle orange_bundle 268 Item\nitem.orange_bundle\nMagenta Bundle magenta_bundle 267 Item\nitem.magenta_bundle\nLight Blue Bundle light_blue_bundle 264 Item\nitem.light_blue_bundle\nYellow Bundle yellow_bundle 273 Item\nitem.yellow_bundle\nLime Bundle lime_bundle 266 Item\nitem.lime_bundle\nPink Bundle pink_bundle 269 Item\nitem.pink_bundle\nGray Bundle gray_bundle 262 Item\nitem.gray_bundle\nLight Gray Bundle light_gray_bundle 265 Item\nitem.light_gray_bundle\nCyan Bundle cyan_bundle 261 Item\nitem.cyan_bundle\nPurple Bundle purple_bundle 270 Item\nitem.purple_bundle\nBlue Bundle blue_bundle 258 Item\nitem.blue_bundle\nBrown Bundle brown_bundle 259 Item\nitem.brown_bundle\nGreen Bundle green_bundle 263 Item\nitem.green_bundle\nRed Bundle red_bundle 271 Item\nitem.red_bundle\nBlack Bundle black_bundle 257 Item\nitem.black_bundle\nItem data[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition:\nSee also: Data component format\n[NBT Compound / JSON Object] components: the item's components tag.\n[NBT List / JSON Array] minecraft:bundle_contents: The items stored inside this bundle.\n[NBT Compound / JSON Object]: A single item stack.\nTags common to all items[show]\nBedrock Edition:\nSee also: Bedrock Edition level format/Item format\nVideos[edit | edit source]\nHistory[edit | edit source]\nOctober 3, 2020 Bundles are revealed at Minecraft Live 2020.

It can be obtained by either NBT editors, inventory editors, or glitches in Bedrock Edition.\nUsage[edit | edit source]\nUsing a camera from one's inventory captures a first-person screenshot. It may also be placed, creating a camera entity that can track the user, and take pictures from the camera's perspective. Photos that are taken with the camera appear in the portfolio.\nClose-up snapshots of an item on the ground can be taken by holding the Shift key while right-clicking.\nScreenshots from camera can be inserted into book and quill.[1]\nPhotos that are taken with the camera block are stored in com.mojang/screenshots.\nBehavior[edit | edit source]\nCamera in a boat\nCameras are mostly inanimate entities, but they occasionally move when falling and they move at the player's direction when they take a picture.\nCameras are classified as mobs in the game code, they obey gravity, allowing them to fall and having effects common to all other entities. Cameras can be affected by status effects. They can be killed by Harming and Decay splash/lingering potions, and they play the player death sound and fall to their side and disappear, dropping no item. Cameras can't be leashed but they can ride on boats and minecarts.\nCamera being harmed by poison effect\nCameras are harmed by fire, lava, and campfire damage but they never die from it. Cameras can be destroyed by any projectile used by the player, such as arrows, tridents, or snowballs. Cameras never drown and are invulnerable to the void, cacti, falling blocks, to explosions or by firework rockets.\nWardens, withers, zoglins, goats, and vindicators named Johnny attack cameras, but the camera remains undamaged; pufferfish also inflate when an camera is nearby.

Eating a carrot restores 3 () hunger and 3.6 hunger saturation.\nFarming[edit | edit source]\nSee also: Crop farming\nCarrots can be farmed and harvested on farmland. Planted carrots go through 8 stages of growth, but only 4 apparent stages because the texture only changes upon reaching stages 1, 3, 5, and 8 with stage 8 being the final, mature appearance.\nCarrots require a light level of 8 or greater to plant‌[Java Edition only] and 9 or greater to grow. In Bedrock Edition they can be planted at any light level, but need an internal light level of 9 to grow. Crops grow faster if the farmland they are planted in is hydrated. Using bone meal on crops also increases the speed of growth by randomly increasing their growth stage by 2 to 5.\nCrops break if pushed by a piston or if their supporting farmland breaks or turns to dirt (e.g. by being trampled), dropping their usual drops.\nIf /gamerule mobGriefing is true, rabbits find mature carrot crops‌[Java Edition only] / carrot crops with growth stage greater than 1‌[Bedrock Edition only]. This reduces the growth stages by one, removing the crop completely when the growth stage reaches 0.\nBreeding[edit | edit source]\nCarrots can also be used to breed and attract pigs and rabbits.\nVillagers can pick up carrot items to become willing, which allow them to breed.

The pig then moves in the direction of the carrot. Also, if the player holds a carrot on a stick, all nearby pigs (but not rabbits[1]) follow the player, but they can't breed using a carrot on a stick.\nTo make the pig run faster, the player can press use while holding the carrot on a stick. This is called \"boosting\". Each boost costs 7 durability in Java Edition, or 2 durability in Bedrock Edition. If the carrot on a stick's durability is depleted, it turns back into a fishing rod.\nThe speed of a mounted pig is 2.42 m/s. Boosting a pig causes its speed to slowly ramp up until it reaches 2.15 times its normal speed, 5.20 m/s. Then speed slowly declines until the pig reaches normal speed again. The boost lasts between 140 and 980 game ticks (7 seconds and 49 seconds respectively), chosen randomly. No matter how many ticks the boost lasts, the average speed of pig during a full boost cycle is roughly 4.19 m/s. These boosted speeds are applied only while holding the carrot on a stick. These speeds are affected by the speed effect.\nRepairing[edit | edit source]\nCombining[edit | edit source]\nIngredients Crafting recipe\n[hide]\nDescription\nDamaged Carrot on a Stick\n\n\nThe durability of the two carrots on sticks is added together, plus an extra point of durability.\nIngredients Grinding recipe\n[hide]\nDescription\n2× Damaged Carrot on a Stick\nThe durability of the two carrots on sticks is added together, plus an extra point of durability.\nUnit repair[edit | edit source]\nMain article: Anvil mechanics § Unit repair\nIngredients\n[hide]\nAnvil recipe\nDamaged Carrot on a Stick\nCarrot on a Stick\nA carrot on a stick can be combined with another carrot on a stick in an anvil, preserving the enchantments of both.\nEnchantments[edit | edit source]\nA carrot on a stick can receive the following enchantments:\nName Description Max Level Method Weight\nUnbreaking Grants a chance to negate durability consumption.

Each defense point reduces any damage dealt to the player, which is absorbed by armor by 4%, increasing additively with the number of defense points. Different materials and combinations of armor provide different levels of defense.\nThe following table shows the amount of defense points added by chestplates.\nMaterial Defense points\nLeather 3 ()\nGolden 5 ()\nChainmail\nIron 6 ()\nDiamond 8 ()\nNetherite\nDurability[edit | edit source]\nThe following table shows the amount of damage each piece of armor can absorb before being destroyed.\nAny \"hit\" from a damage source that can be blocked by armor removes one point of durability from each piece of armor worn for every 4HP of incoming damage (rounded down, but never below 1). Damage taken that unenchanted armor does not protect against (such as falling or drowning) does not damage the armor, even if it is enchanted to protect against that type of damage. The following chart displays how many hits chest plates can endure.\nNetherite armor is not damaged by lava or fire when worn.\nMaterial Durability\nLeather 80\nGolden 112\nChainmail 240\nIron\nDiamond 528\nNetherite 592\nRepairing[edit | edit source]\nCombining[edit | edit source]\nIngredients Crafting recipe\n[hide]\nDescription\nDamaged Leather Tunic or\nDamaged Chainmail Chestplate or\nDamaged Iron Chestplate or\nDamaged Golden Chestplate or\nDamaged Diamond Chestplate or\nDamaged Netherite Chestplate\n\n\nThe durability of the two chestplates is added together, plus an extra 5% durability.

The basic versions require iron. The advanced versions require steel, which you make by combining iron and coal. Carrying swords, armor or helmets take up inventory slots, but otherwise have no penalty and work pretty much as you expect (prevent some damage, or cause more damage)\".\nAugust 13, 2009 Notch tested chestplates on the human. They were merely aesthetic at the time and had no effect on gameplay.\n0.24_SURVIVAL_TEST Added the plate chestplate.\nAdded the model and the texture for the unused chain chestplate.\nThe plate chestplate has been tested on zombies and skeletons.

Previous to this update, the total armor protection is based in this equation: ((total equipped armor damage reduction − 1) × (all equipped armor max damage − total equipped armor damage)) ÷ (total equipped armor max damage + 1)).

For the item in Minecraft Dungeons, see Minecraft Dungeons:Chorus Fruit.\nChorus Fruit\nRarity tier\nCommon\nRenewable\nYes\nStackable\nYes (64)\nRestores\n4 ()\nChorus fruit is a food item native to the End that can be eaten, or smelted into popped chorus fruit. It can be eaten even when the hunger bar is full, and eating it may teleport the player up to 8 blocks in any direction.\nContents\n1 Obtaining\n1.1 Mining\n2 Usage\n2.1 Eating\n2.2 Teleportation\n2.3 Smelting ingredient\n3 Sounds\n3.1 Generic\n3.2 Unique\n4 Data values\n4.1 ID\n5 Advancements\n6 History\n6.1 Data history\n7 Issues\n8 References\n9 External links\n10 Navigation\nObtaining[edit | edit source]\nMining[edit | edit source]\nSee also: Tutorials/Chorus fruit farming\nChorus fruit can be obtained by breaking chorus plant blocks. Each block of chorus plant has a 50% chance to drop a chorus fruit. This is not affected by Fortune.[1]\nUsage[edit | edit source]\nEating[edit | edit source]\nTo eat chorus fruit, press and hold use while it is selected in the hotbar. Eating one restores 4 () hunger and 2.4 hunger saturation.\nUnlike most foods, chorus fruits can be eaten when the player has a full hunger bar.\nTeleportation[edit | edit source]\nThe player may also be teleported: up to 16 attempts are made to choose a random destination within ±8 on all three axes in the same manner as enderman teleportation, with the exception that the player may teleport into an area only 2 blocks high, or one block tall if the player is crawling. The player does not land in the average centroid of the block, but rather to any position within an 8-block range. The player is teleported directly down to the ground regardless of the height it was used at if the player is too far from a valid destination.\nThe chorus fruit, unlike an ender pearl, can teleport the player through solid blocks. The algorithm tries to avoid fluids; the player cannot teleport into a space occupied by water or lava. However, the player can be teleported onto dangerous blocks such as fire, cacti and magma blocks.[2]\nIf a teleport succeeds, a sound similar to an enderman teleporting plays originating from the teleportation origin location. Chorus fruit has a cooldown of 1 second before being able to be used again. The cooldown is represented by a white overlay on the chorus fruit in the hotbar. The cooldown is applied to all chorus fruits items, including those in the player's inventory and containers.[3]\nEating chorus fruit removes all fall damage, regardless of the distance the player has fallen.\nEating chorus fruit may teleport the player into areas protected by bedrock, barrier blocks, or other blocks that are otherwise unbreakable in Survival mode. However, it cannot teleport the player onto the Nether roof.[4]\nChorus fruit is completely non-functional above the Nether roof.\nFoxes can also eat chorus fruit and the teleportation effect works the same as with players.\nSmelting ingredient[edit | edit source]\nIngredients\n[hide]\nSmelting recipe\nChorus Fruit +\nAny fuel\n\n\n0.1\nSounds[edit | edit source]\nGeneric[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition:\n[hide]\nv t e\nSounds\nSound Subtitles Source Description Resource location Translation key Volume Pitch Attenuation\ndistance\nEating Players While a player is eating something entity.generic.eat subtitles.entity.generic.eat varies [sound 1] 0.8-1.2 16\nEating Friendly Creatures When a player finishes eating something entity.generic.eat subtitles.entity.generic.eat 1.0 0.6-1.4 16\nBurp Players When a player finishes eating something entity.player.burp subtitles.entity.player.burp 0.5 0.9-1.0 16\n↑ Can be 0.5, 1.0, or 1.5\nBedrock Edition:\n[hide]\nv t e\nSounds\nSound Source Description Resource location Volume Pitch\nPlayers While a player is eating something random.eat 0.5-1.1 0.8-1.2\nPlayers When a player finishes eating something random.burp 0.5 0.9-1.0\nUnique[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition\n[hide]\nSounds\nSound Subtitles Source Description Resource location Translation key Volume Pitch Attenuation\ndistance\nPlayer teleports Players When a player teleports by eating a chorus fruit item.chorus_fruit.teleport subtitles.item.chorus_fruit.teleport 1.0 1.0 16\nFox teleports Players & Friendly Creatures[sound 1] When a fox teleports by eating a chorus fruit entity.fox.teleport subtitles.entity.fox.teleport 1.0 1.0 16\n↑ MC-257516 — \"Fox teleports\" sound plays for both Players and Friendly Creatures sound categories\nBedrock Edition:\n[hide]\nSounds\nSound Source Description Resource location Volume Pitch\nHostile Creatures When something teleports by eating a chorus fruit mob.shulker.teleport 1.0 1.0\nData values[edit | edit source]\nID[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition:\nName Identifier Form\n[hide]\nTranslation key\nChorus Fruit chorus_fruit Item\nitem.minecraft.chorus_fruit\nBedrock Edition:\nName Identifier Numeric ID Form\n[hide]\nTranslation key\nChorus Fruit chorus_fruit 558 Item\nitem.chorus_fruit.name\nAdvancements[edit | edit source]\nIcon Advancement In-game description Actual requirements (if different)\nA Balanced Diet Eat everything that is edible, even if it's not good for you\nEat each of these 40 foods:[hide]\nApple Baked Potato Beetroot Beetroot Soup Bread Carrot Chorus Fruit Cooked Chicken Cooked Cod Cooked Mutton Cooked Porkchop Cooked Rabbit Cooked Salmon Cookie Dried Kelp Enchanted Golden Apple Glow Berries Golden Apple Golden Carrot Honey Bottle Melon Slice Mushroom Stew Poisonous Potato Potato Pufferfish Pumpkin Pie Rabbit Stew Raw Beef Raw Chicken Raw Cod Raw Mutton Raw Porkchop Raw Rabbit Raw Salmon Rotten Flesh Spider Eye Steak Suspicious Stew Sweet Berries Tropical Fish\nOther foods and consumables can be eaten, but are ignored for this advancement.\nHusbandry The world is full of friends and food Consume anything that can be consumed, except for cake.\nHistory[edit | edit source]\n[hide]\nJava Edition\n1.9 15w31a Added chorus fruit.\n15w34c A cooldown for using chorus fruit has now been added.\n15w37a The chorus fruit's teleportation range has now been reduced from ±32 to ±8.\n15w50a Added a sound for chorus fruit: item.chorus_fruit.teleport.\n1.10 16w21a Chorus fruit can now teleport riders off their mounts.\n1.14 18w43a The texture of chorus fruit has now been changed.\n1.20.2 23w33a Eating chorus fruit now resets fall distance.[5]\n[hide]\nPocket Edition\n1.0.0 alpha 0.17.0.1 Added chorus fruit.\nalpha 1.0.0.1 The cooldown of chorus fruit now has an animation.\n[hide]\nBedrock Edition\n1.7.0 beta 1.7.0.2 The category that chorus fruit are apart of in the Creative inventory has been changed from \"Nature\" to \"Items\".\n1.10.0 beta 1.10.0.3 The texture of chorus fruit has now been changed.\n1.11.0 beta 1.11.0.1 Chorus fruit now plays teleport sound after eating it.\n1.13.0 beta 1.13.0.15 Chorus fruit has been moved back to the \"Nature\" section in the Creative inventory.\n[hide]\nLegacy Console Edition\nXbox 360 Xbox One PS3 PS4 PS Vita Wii U Switch\nTU46 CU36 1.38 1.38 1.38 Patch 15 1.0.1 Added chorus fruit.\nChorus fruits can be eaten in creative mode.\nTU48 CU38 1.41 1.41 1.41 Patch 17 Chorus fruits are no longer consumed when eaten in creative mode.[is this the correct version?]\n1.90 The texture of chorus fruit has now been changed.\n[hide]\nNew Nintendo 3DS Edition\n1.7.10 Added chorus fruit.\nData history[edit | edit source]\n[hide]\nJava Edition\n1.13 17w47a Prior to The Flattening, this item's numeral ID was 432.\nIssues[edit | edit source]\nIssues relating to \"Chorus Fruit\" are maintained on the bug tracker.

The dial spins clockwise slowly to indicate the time of day, corresponding to the sun or moon's actual position in the sky. When the time of day changes suddenly, such as after sleeping or when /time is used, the clock dial spins rapidly to catch up. The player is able to sleep a few seconds after the clock shows exactly dusk.\nThe dial always shows the current in-game time when in the Overworld, regardless of where it appears. This includes a player's hand, an inventory slot, a crafting grid, an item frame, or even as a dropped item. For a clock to be mounted on a wall, an item frame is required.\nBecause there is no day/night cycle in the Nether or the End, clocks do not work properly in these dimensions. Instead, the dial rotates rapidly and randomly. Although clocks do not function in these dimensions, the actual daylight cycle does continue.\nPiglins[edit | edit source]\nPiglins are attracted to clocks and run toward any clock on the ground, and inspect it for 6 to 8 seconds before putting it in their inventory.\nData values[edit | edit source]\nID[edit | edit source]\nName Identifier Form\n[hide]\nTranslation key\nClock clock Item\nitem.minecraft.clock\nBedrock Edition:\nName Identifier Numeric ID Form\n[hide]\nTranslation key\nClock clock 393 Item\nitem.clock.name\nAchievements[edit | edit source]\n[hide]\nIcon Achievement In-game description Actual requirements (if different) Gamerscore earned Trophy type (PS)\nPS4 Other\nOooh, shiny!

The log does not need to be attached to a tree. A cocoa pod can be placed on jungle logs, jungle wood, stripped jungle logs and stripped jungle wood.\nCocoa has three stages of growth. During its first stage, the pod is small and green. In the second stage, the plant is bigger and colored tan. In its last stage, the pod is even larger and orange. The cocoa block has a 20% chance to grow a stage when receiving a random tick, giving it an average time of 5 minutes and 41 seconds per stage. When destroyed in the first two stages, the pod yields only one cocoa bean. When destroyed in the third stage, it gives 3 cocoa beans. Bone meal can be used to force the cocoa pod forward by one growth stage. Cocoa pods burst and drop their beans when struck by flowing water, pushed by a piston or if their log or wood are removed by any means.\nComposting[edit | edit source]\nPlacing cocoa beans into a composter has a 65% chance of raising the compost level by 1.\nCrafting ingredient[edit | edit source]\nIn Bedrock Edition, cocoa beans are accepted as a direct substitute of brown dye in many recipes.\nJava Edition[edit | edit source]\nName Ingredients\n[hide]\nCrafting recipe\nBrown Dye Cocoa Beans\n\nCookie Wheat +\nCocoa Beans\n\n8\n\nBedrock Edition and Minecraft Education[edit | edit source]\nName Ingredients Crafting recipe\n[hide]\nDescription\nBrown Balloon Latex +\nCocoa Beans +\nHelium +\nLead\n\nBrown Bed Any Bed +\nCocoa Beans\n\nBrown Carpet White Carpet +\nCocoa Beans\n\nBrown Concrete Powder Cocoa Beans +\nSand +\nGravel\n\n8\nBrown Firework Star White Firework Star or\nBlue Firework Star or\nBrown Firework Star or\nBlack Firework Star +\nCocoa Beans\n\nAdds a \"fade to color\" effect to the firework star, overwriting any existing fades.\nUp to eight dyes can be added.\nBrown Firework Star Gunpowder +\nCocoa Beans +\nHead or\nGold Nugget or\nFeather or\nFire Charge +\nGlowstone Dust +\nDiamond\n\nUp to eight dyes can be added.\nOne head, gold nugget, feather, or fire charge can be added.

They will also point towards their target position when viewed in the crafting table preview menu, even without being crafted.‌[Bedrock Edition only] The direction of the needle is relative to the player viewing it.\nNormal compasses point toward the world spawn point in the Overworld. Using the /setworldspawn command to change the world spawn can change where normal compasses point.\nIf a compass or lodestone compass is used on a lodestone, it becomes a lodestone compass that points towards that lodestone. Compasses and lodestone compasses do not stack together, and only lodestone compasses that point towards the same lodestone stack together. All lodestone compasses have an enchantment visual effect to distinguish them from normal compasses.\nA compass or lodestone compass will spin and point in random directions if it cannot find its target position. There are two causes for this:\nIf the compass is in a different dimension to its target position (e.g. a lodestone compass is in the Overworld but its target lodestone is in the Nether), its needle will spin randomly. Because of this, normal compasses only work in the Overworld (as their target position is the Overworld spawn point) and will always spin randomly in the Nether and End.\nIf a lodestone compass's target lodestone is broken, it will spin randomly, even if the lodestone is replaced in the same position. The only way to 'fix' a 'broken' lodestone compass is to use it on any lodestone to make it point towards it. However, if a lodestone compass is placed in a storage block, the lodestone can be broken and replaced without causing the compass to spin randomly, as long as the compass remains in storage while the lodestone is missing.\nIn Java Edition, uncrafted compasses viewed in the crafting table preview will always point straight forward and never at any particular position in the world.\nCrafting ingredient[edit | edit source]\nName Ingredients Crafting recipe\n[hide]\nDescription\nEmpty Locator Map‌[BE only]\n\nEmpty Map‌[JE only] Paper +\nCompass\n\nThis map records terrain and displays a marker showing the player's location.\nMap\n(with marker) Map or Empty Map +\nCompass\n\n\n‌[Bedrock Edition only]\nMaps crafted from only paper do not show the location marker; to add it, a compass must be added to the map.

The enchantments are never treasure enchantments.\nUsage[edit | edit source]\nDespite using iron ingots in their crafting recipe, crossbows cannot be smelted into iron nuggets.[1]\nWeapon[edit | edit source]\nCharging and shooting the crossbow in Bedrock Edition.\nCrossbows are similar to bows, but take longer to load and are slightly more powerful, shooting farther with slightly higher accuracy. Alternatively, they can be loaded with a firework rocket, which flies in a straight line.\nLoad them by using them, which makes the player move at sneak speed. Unlike bows, the arrow or firework rocket can be fired only if the player releases the use button after the crossbow is loaded‌[Java Edition only] or if the crossbow finishes its loading animation‌[Bedrock Edition only]. At this point, it must be used a second time to fire its bolt.\nOnce it has reached full charge, the player's speed returns to normal. After that, shooting a charged crossbow does not delay any of the player's current actions like sprinting or swimming.\nThe crossbow can even be placed in another inventory slot or into an item frame without the arrow or firework rocket being unloaded or fired. A charged crossbow also remains charged after enchanting it with an enchantment table or with an anvil.\nIn order to use the crossbow, at least one arrow or firework rocket must be present in the inventory. The player can choose the type of arrow to fire based on its location in their inventory:\nArrows in the off-hand, or the selected hotbar slot if the crossbow is in the off-hand, are prioritized first.\nIf there are no arrows in the off-hand or selected hotbar slot, the arrow closest to slot 0 is selected.\nCrossbows take 1.25 seconds (25 ticks) to load.\nThe player can load either an arrow, spectral arrow, tipped arrow (of any effect) or a firework (of any color/type).\nEndermen teleport away from projectile paths, so they cannot be hit with crossbow arrows. However, they can still get harmed by firework rocket explosions, if they cannot detect the firework rocket.\nAttack strength\nJava Edition:\nDamage Arrow Max firework\nMinimum 7HP 11HP × 5.5\nAverage 9HP 14.5HP × 7.25\nMaximum 11HP × 5.5 18HP × 9\nBedrock Edition\nAlways 9HP\nFireworks[edit | edit source]\nFirework rockets can be fired by loading the crossbow only while holding the rockets in the off-hand. They fly at 32 m/s. Firework rockets with higher flight duration have a longer time before they explode and therefore travel farther. Firing a firework rocket uses 3 durability points per shot.\nFirework rocket range\nMinimum Average Maximum Gunpowder\n32m (20 ticks) 40.8m (25.5 ticks) 49.6m (31 ticks) 1 ()\n48m (30 ticks) 56.8m (35.5 ticks) 65.6m (41 ticks) 2 ()\n64m (40 ticks) 72.8m (45.5 ticks) 81.6m (51 ticks) 3 ()\nFirework rockets also work with the Multishot enchantment, enabling the player to shoot 3 firework rockets at a time. The increased durability usage stacks, resulting in 9 durability being consumed with each shot.\nA shot firework rocket explodes instantly when it hits a mob or block.‌[Java Edition only] If the firework rocket has no explosion effect, it deals no damage. The explosion of a firework rocket deals 5HP to 6HP points of damage, with one firework star. The explosion has a radius of roughly 4 blocks, which is unaffected by the firework star's effect. Each additional firework star on the rocket deals an additional 1HP to 2HP points of damage, for a maximum of 11HP × 5.5 to 18HP × 9 with 7 firework stars. The flight duration of the firework increases the maximum range the firework can travel before exploding, but does not affect the damage output. Likewise, the damage remains the same regardless of any dyes used. The Piercing enchantment does not affect firework rockets shot from crossbows. Unlike an arrow shot from a bow, the firework does not slow down under water.\nRepairing[edit | edit source]\nCombining[edit | edit source]\nIngredients Crafting recipe\n[hide]\nDescription\n2× Damaged Crossbow or\n2× Damaged Arrow Loaded Crossbow or\n2× Damaged Firework Loaded Crossbow\n\n\nThe durability of the two crossbows is added together, plus an extra 5% durability.

Issues should be reported and viewed there.\nTrivia[edit | edit source]\nAlongside pillagers, crossbows were inspired by Minecraft Dungeons, even though they were added in the base game first.[2]\nCrossbows enchanted with Quick Charge VI and above get stuck on the first frame on the recharging animation because the resulting charge time is negative, and the game never reaches the time markers that tell it to advance the animation or the reloading procedure itself. It is technically possible to charge such crossbows, but this would require overflowing the value that determines how long the crossbow has been charged. This takes such an amount of time that this is practically impossible: for example, charging a crossbow with Quick Charge VI would take 69.4 years to complete.\nAlthough Piercing allows arrows to bypass shields, they cannot get through the wither's armor or a shulker's shell.\nThe crossbow's first-person loading animation in Bedrock Edition is different from Java Edition.\nIn real life, crossbows do not shoot the same arrows as bows, rather they shoot shorter, thicker, and oftentimes fletchless arrows (usually called \"bolts\") made to withstand the crossbow's increased power, which can shatter conventional arrows.\nGallery[edit | edit source]\nIcons[edit | edit source]\nAn enchanted crossbow.\nRenders[edit | edit source]\nSteve charging a crossbow in Java Edition.\nAlex charging a crossbow in Java Edition.\nA pillager charging a crossbow.\nA piglin charging a crossbow.\nSteve aiming a crossbow.\nAlex aiming a crossbow.\nA pillager aiming a crossbow in Bedrock Edition.\nA piglin aiming a crossbow in Bedrock Edition.\nScreenshots[edit | edit source]\nHow the crossbow is equipped.\nA zombified piglin with a crossbow\n(It will not shoot, only melee attack).\nPillager who broke its crossbow.\n\"Noor, basking in the sunset, fires a Crossbow with a custom enchantment that allows for multiple Firework Rockets to be fired simultaneously.\"[3]\nDevelopment images[edit | edit source]\nA crossbow shown at MINECON Earth 2018.\nA pillager armed with a crossbow, shown at MINECON Earth 2018.\nFirst image of a crossbow with the piercing enchantment.\nReferences[edit | edit source]\n↑ MC-111738\n↑ \"March 2021 developper Q&A\" – on Discord, March 11, 2021.\n↑ \"Minecraft Java Edition 1.21\" – minecraft.net, June 13, 2024.\nExternal links[edit | edit source]\nTaking Inventory: Crossbow – Minecraft.net on October 20, 2022\nNavigation[edit | edit source]\n[hide]\nv t e\nItems\n[hide]\nEquipment\nTools Axe Brush Elytra Fishing Rod Carrot on a Stick Warped Fungus on a Stick Flint and Steel Hoe Pickaxe Shears Shovel\nWeapons Axe Mace Bow Crossbow Shield Sword Trident\nAmmunition Arrow Tipped Arrow Firework Rocket\nJE only Spectral Arrow\nArmor Boots Chestplate Helmet Turtle Shell Horse Armor Leggings Wolf Armor\n[show]\nUtilities\n[show]\nFood\n[show]\nIngredients\n[show]\nCreative or commands only\n[show]\nUnused\n[show]\nUnimplemented\n[show]\nJoke features\n[show]\nRemoved",

For other uses, see Debug.\nThis feature is exclusive to Java Edition. \nDebug Stick\nRarity tier\nEpic\nRenewable\nNo\nStackable\nNo\nThe debug stick is an item used to edit the block states of blocks. It is visually identical to a regular stick, but with a glint (as if enchanted).\nContents\n1 Obtaining\n2 Usage\n3 Data values\n3.1 ID\n3.2 Item data\n4 History\n5 Issues\n6 Trivia\n7 Gallery\n7.1 In other media\n8 See also\n9 References\n10 Navigation\nObtaining[edit | edit source]\nThe debug stick is obtainable via commands such as /give or /item, or the Creative inventory if the player has the appropriate permissions. It can be obtained only in worlds with commands on.\nUsage[edit | edit source]\nThe debug stick can be used to change block states. Hitting the block allows players to select the block state key they wish to change, for an example, switching between the conditional and the facing block state keys for a command block. Using the block allows them to cycle through the valid values for the block state key, again as an example, the player can make the command block face, down, east, north, south, up, or west if they chose the facing block state key. Sneaking while hitting or using cycles through the block state keys or values in reverse order.\nIt is notable that using debug stick directly on an interactive block without sneaking uses the block itself instead of the stick.[1]\nThe debug stick cannot be used while in Survival or Adventure mode. It works only in Creative mode with cheats enabled. In modes other than Creative, it acts like a regular item — although when using it on a block, the player swings the stick as if interacting with it (but nothing happens).\nData values[edit | edit source]\nID[edit | edit source]\nName Identifier Form\n[hide]\nTranslation key\nDebug Stick debug_stick Item\nitem.minecraft.debug_stick\nItem data[edit | edit source]\nSee also: Data component format\n[NBT Compound / JSON Object] components: the item's components tag.\n[NBT Compound / JSON Object] minecraft:debug_stick_state: The selected block state properties used by this debug stick.\n[String] <block ID>: A key-value pair, where the key is a block ID and the value is a block state key to edit on the block, for example \"minecraft:oak_fence\": \"east\".\nHistory[edit | edit source]\n[hide]\nJava Edition\n1.13 17w47a Added debug sticks.\n1.16 20w10a Debug sticks are now capable of editing fire due to its added hitbox.\n1.19.3 22w44a The debug stick is now available in the creative inventory, but only if cheats are enabled.\n22w45a Moved the debug stick behind the Operator Utilities tab in the creative inventory. The tab is only available if cheats are enabled and the \"Operator Items Tab\" option in the controls menu is turned on.\nIssues[edit | edit source]\nThe debug stick is not supported, and any issues resulting of its usage are closed as \"Won't Fix\" in the issue tracker.\nIssues with the stick itself are considered valid.[2][3]\nIssues relating to \"Debug Stick\" are maintained on the bug tracker.

An ore drops a single diamond. If mined by any other tool, it drops nothing. If the pickaxe is enchanted with Fortune, it has a chance of dropping an extra diamond per level of Fortune, allowing for a maximum of 4 diamonds with Fortune III. If the ore is mined using a pickaxe enchanted with Silk Touch, it drops an ore block rather than a diamond. The ore is found at level 15 or lower, most commonly between -50 and -64; levels -58 and -59 are the preferred levels to mine at since they don't contain bedrock, as it starts spawning at -60.\nGenerated loot[edit | edit source]\nItem Structure Container Quantity\n[hide]\nChance\nJava Edition\nDiamond Mineshaft Chest 1–2 8.9%\nBastion Remnant Treasure chest 2–6 14.3%\nBuried Treasure

The enchantments are never treasure enchantments.\nUsage[edit | edit source]\nBreaking[edit | edit source]\nDiamond axes can break wood-related blocks faster than other tools. Breaking a block costs 1 durability.[note 1]\n↑ Blocks that break instantly don't use up durability.\nStripping[edit | edit source]\nUsing a diamond axe on a log, wood block, or block of bamboo turns it into a stripped log, stripped wood, or block of stripped bamboo, respectively. This costs 1 point of durability of the axe.\nCopper blocks[edit | edit source]\nUsing a diamond axe on a waxed or oxidized copper block removes the wax if it has any, or otherwise remove a level of oxidization. This costs 1 point of durability.\nWeapon[edit | edit source]\nWhen used as a weapon, a diamond axe loses 2 durability points.\nJava Edition[edit | edit source]\nAttacking a shield user with an axe disables the use of the shield for 5 seconds. Vindicators, piglin brutes, or other mobs with commands always disable the player's shield. Damage done when using an axe as a weapon is more than that of a sword of the same tier, though they take longer than a sword to recover, resulting in lower DPS.\nAttack Damage Attack Speed Recovery time DPS Lifetime damage inflicted[note 1]\n9HP 1.0 1 second (20 game ticks) 9.0 7029HP × 3514.5\n↑ The formula to find the total lifetime damage is ceil(durability ÷ 2) × damage per hit. The durability is halved then ceiled because axes take double durability when used as a weapon, and the last 1 durability can also deal damage. The formula also ignores enchantments and critical hits, and assumes each attack is performed at maximum charge.\nBedrock Edition[edit | edit source]\nDiamond axes attack instantly with no cooldown and deal 7HP damage, but they lower the durability of armor and shields faster than a sword would do.\nRepairing[edit | edit source]\nCombining[edit | edit source]\nIngredients Crafting recipe\n[hide]\nDescription\nDamaged Diamond Axe\n\n\nThe durability of the two axes is added together, plus an extra 3 points of durability.\nIngredients Grinding recipe\n[hide]\nDescription\n2× Damaged Diamond Axe\nThe durability of the two axes is added together, plus an extra 3 points of durability.\nAnvil repair[edit | edit source]\nMain article: Anvil mechanics § Unit repair\nIngredients\n[hide]\nAnvil recipe\nDamaged Diamond Axe +\nDiamond\nDiamond Axe\nA diamond axe can be repaired in an anvil by adding diamonds, with each ingot restoring 25% of the axe's maximum durability, rounded down.

Breaking one of these blocks takes 1 durability.\nBreaking any other block takes 0 durability if the block breaks instantly when broken by hand, or 1 otherwise.\nTilling[edit | edit source]\nHoes are used to turn dirt, grass blocks, and dirt paths into farmland. To till, press use on a grass or dirt block while holding a hoe. This does not work on mycelium or podzol,[1] nor does it work if there are other blocks on top of the targeted blocks, including snow layers or torches. However, mycelium and podzol can be first converted to dirt paths with a shovel, then tilled into farmland with a hoe.\nHoes can be used to convert coarse dirt into regular dirt by pressing use on the coarse dirt. Similar to tilling dirt, the space above the coarse dirt must be empty for it to be tilled.\nHoes can also be used on rooted dirt, which turns it into normal dirt, and yields a hanging roots item.\nTilling is effectively instantaneous, regardless of material, and uses 1 durability. Breaking blocks with a hoe uses 0 or 1 durability, depending on the block.\nHoes are unable to work on blocks with a plant on top, even if that plant could normally be placed on top of farmland without reverting it to dirt.[2]\nWeapon[edit | edit source]\nHoes may be used as a weapon, although they deal only 1HP damage in Java Edition. In Bedrock Edition, hoes can do as much as a pickaxe in terms of damage. Hoes use 1 durability when used as a weapon.\nIn Java Edition, diamond hoes have an attack speed modifier 0 (refill in 0.25s).\nHoes always attack instantly in Bedrock Edition.\nRepairing[edit | edit source]\nCombining[edit | edit source]\nIngredients Crafting recipe\n[hide]\nDescription\nDamaged Diamond Hoe\n\n\nThe durability of the two hoes is added together, plus an extra 5% durability.\nIngredients Grinding recipe\n[hide]\nDescription\n2x Damaged Diamond Hoe\nThe durability of the two hoes is added together, plus an extra 5% durability.\nUnit repair[edit | edit source]\nMain article: Anvil mechanics § Unit repair\nIngredients\n[hide]\nAnvil recipe\nDamaged Diamond Hoe +\nDiamond\nDiamond Hoe\nA hoe can be repaired in an anvil by adding units of the tiers' repair material, with each repair material restoring 25% the hoe's maximum durability, rounded down. Two hoes of the same tier can also be combined in an anvil. Both methods preserve the hoe's enchantments.\nEnchantments[edit | edit source]\nA hoe can receive the following enchantments:\nName Description Max Level Method Weight\nEfficiency Increases the mining speed.

In Minecraft Education dyes can also be used to dye balloons and glow sticks.\nIn Bedrock Edition and Minecraft Education, bone meal, ink sacs, lapis lazuli, and cocoa beans can generally substitute for white dye, black dye, blue dye, and brown dye, respectively, in crafting recipes and for use in dyeing items or mobs. However, they have other important uses that aren't related to color, and are therefore not considered true dyes. They are mentioned in this article only in regard to their use as dyeing agents; see their individual articles for complete information about them.\nA guide for creating all the dyes, from which leather armor can be colored in 5,713,438 possible colors[1][2]\nContents\n1 Obtaining\n1.1 Crafting dye\n1.2 Smelting\n1.3 Generated loot\n1.4 Trading\n2 Usage\n2.1 Crafting\n2.1.1 Wool\n2.1.2 Carpets\n2.1.3 Terracotta\n2.1.4 Concrete powder\n2.1.5 Stained glass\n2.1.6 Stained glass panes\n2.1.7 Shulker boxes\n2.1.8 Beds\n2.1.9 Candles\n2.1.10 Bundles\n2.1.11 Firework stars\n2.1.12 Balloons\n2.1.13 Glow sticks\n2.2 Banner patterns\n2.3 Dyeing armor\n2.4 Dyeing sheep\n2.5 Dyeing collars\n2.6 Dyeing signs\n2.7 Dyeing water inside cauldrons\n2.8 Trading\n3 Color values\n4 Sounds\n5 Achievements\n6 Video\n7 History\n8 Gallery\n9 Issues\n10 Trivia\n11 References\n12 External links\n13 Navigation\nObtaining[edit | edit source]\nAn in-game guide for creating all the dyes\nMost dyes can be crafted from flowers and a few other items, some dyes can be crafted by combining multiple dyes of different colors, and every dye is sold by the wandering trader.

Each pattern uses 1 dye, which also determines the color of that pattern.\nDyeing armor[edit | edit source]\nA graph showing all combinations of two dyes on a leather tunic. In total, leather armor can be colored in 5,713,438 possible colors[1][2]\nLeather armor, wolf armor, and leather horse armor can be dyed:\nIn Java Edition, armor is dyed by crafting it and dyes together on a crafting table.\nIn Bedrock and Legacy Console editions, armor is dyed by using it on a cauldron filled with dyed water. This consumes 1 layer of water but does not change the color of the water.\nThe armor can be undyed by using it on a cauldron with undyed water. This changes the water's color to the color of the armor and changes the armor to have no dye color.\nIt is possible to put more than one dye alongside the armor. Armor can be dyed multiple times with previous colors affecting the final outcome. Colored armor can be reverted to their original color using a cauldron with undyed water.\nThe game has a specific formula for calculating the color of dyed armor: each color, in the RGBA color model, has a red value, green value, blue value and layer opacity or alpha value. For each dye in the crafting grid, and the armor itself (if it is already dyed), the red, green, and blue values are added to running totals. In addition, a running total of the highest value (be it red, green, or blue) is also kept. After this, each total is divided by the number of colors used. This effectively produces the average red, green, blue, and maximum values. The maximum value of the average RGB values is also calculated. Finally, the average maximum value is divided by the maximum of the average RGB values. The average RGB values are then used as the final color and the modified average maximum value used as the layer opacity value. This procedure can be summed up with the following pseudocode:\nset all \"total\" variables to 0\nset numberOfColors to 0\nfor each color:\n set totalRed to: totalRed + redValue\n set totalGreen to: totalGreen + greenValue\n set totalBlue to: totalBlue + blueValue\n set totalMaximum to: totalMaximum + (max of redValue, greenValue, blueValue)\n set numberOfColors to: numberOfColors + 1\n\nset averageRed to: totalRed / numberOfColors\nset averageGreen to: totalGreen / numberOfColors\nset averageBlue to: totalBlue / numberOfColors\nset averageMaximum to: totalMaximum / numberOfColors\n\nset maximumOfAverage to: max of averageRed, averageGreen, averageBlue\nset alphaFactor to: averageMaximum / maximumOfAverage\n\nset resultRed to: averageRed\nset resultGreen to: averageGreen\nset resultBlue to: averageBlue\nset resultLayerOpacity to: alphaFactor\nDue to the way this formula works, the resulting color can never be darker than the average of the input colors and is often lighter and more saturated. Of course, the resulting color can never be lighter or more saturated than the lightest or most saturated input color. In addition, this formula never creates an RGB value higher than 255 (which would be invalid in the 8-bit RGB color model). Finally, this formula does not allow for every possible color to be obtained. Therefore, not all dyed armors are obtainable.\nIf armor is renamed on an anvil, it retains its name when dyed or undyed.\nMixing samples\n+ =\n#FED83D\n+ + =\n#C898BE\n+ + =\n#B56D51\nDyeing sheep[edit | edit source]\nDyes can be used on sheep to change the color of the wool. Shearing a colored sheep drops the corresponding color of the wool, and the sheep retains the color when the wool regenerates. Breeding colored sheep produces a lamb colored as one of the parent sheep, or a color resulting from the combination of both parents' color. The color combining follows the same rules that dyes use – red and yellow sheep produce an orange lamb, but a blue and yellow sheep cannot create a green lamb. The unlimited reproduction of colored sheep makes dyeing and shearing sheep infinitely more efficient than just dyeing wool directly.\nDyeing collars[edit | edit source]\nDye can also be used on a tamed wolf or cat to change the color of its collar from the default red to the color of the dye.\nDyeing signs[edit | edit source]\nDye can be used on a sign or a hanging sign to change the text color. In Bedrock Edition, ink sacs cannot be used for this purpose; black dye must be used to change the text to black.\nDyeing water inside cauldrons[edit | edit source]\nThis feature is exclusive to Bedrock Edition. \nWater can be dyed in a cauldron by holding any dye in the hand and pressing use on a cauldron filled with water.\nTrading[edit | edit source]\nApprentice, journeyman and expert-level shepherd villagers buy 12 of any of the dyes for an emerald.\nColor values[edit | edit source]\nThe \"color codes\" are used to determine the color imparted on sheep, wolf and cat collars, firework stars, beacon beams, and dyed leather armor, leather horse armor and wolf armor. The hex value is shown in the extended tooltips of dyed armor; however, to set the color using an NBT data tag in a command, the decimal value must be used instead. The color values for firework stars are slightly different. Color codes are usually encoded using the corresponding numeric id, although e.g. signs store the color name instead to represent text color.\nId Name Color code Firework color code\nDec Hex Dec Hex\n0 white 16383998‌[JE only]\n15790320‌[BE only]\n #F9FFFE‌[JE only]\n\n #F0F0F0‌[BE only] 15790320\n #F0F0F0\n1 orange 16351261\n #F9801D 15435844\n #EB8844\n2 magenta 13061821\n #C74EBD 12801229\n #C354CD\n3 light_blue 3847130\n #3AB3DA 6719955\n #6689D3\n4 yellow 16701501\n #FED83D 14602026\n #DECF2A\n5 lime 8439583\n #80C71F 4312372\n #41CD34\n6 pink 15961002\n #F38BAA 14188952\n #D88198\n7 gray 4673362\n #474F52 4408131\n #434343\n8 light_gray 10329495\n #9D9D97 11250603\n #ABABAB\n9 cyan 1481884\n #169C9C 2651799\n #287697\n10 purple 8991416\n #8932B8 8073150\n #7B2FBE\n11 blue 3949738\n #3C44AA 2437522\n #253192\n12 brown 8606770\n #835432 5320730\n #51301A\n13 green 6192150\n #5E7C16 3887386\n #3B511A\n14 red 11546150\n #B02E26 11743532\n #B3312C\n15 black 1908001\n #1D1D21 1973019\n #1E1B1B\nSounds[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition\n[hide]\nSounds\nSound Subtitles Source Description Resource location Translation key Volume Pitch Attenuation\ndistance\nDye stains Blocks When dye is used on a sign item.dye.use subtitles.item.dye.use 1.0 1.0/0.9/0.95/1.1 16\nDye stains Players When dye is used on a sheep item.dye.use subtitles.item.dye.use 1.0 1.0/0.9/0.95/1.1 16\nBedrock Edition:\n[hide]\nSounds\nSound Source Description Resource location Volume Pitch\nSound When dye is used on a sign sign.dye.use 1.0 1.0\nBlocks When dye is added to a cauldron cauldron.adddye 0.1 1.0\nBlocks When armor is dyed using a cauldron cauldron.dyearmor 0.1 1.0\nBlocks When dye is removed from armor using a cauldron cauldron.cleanarmor 0.1 1.0\nAchievements[edit | edit source]\n[hide]\nIcon Achievement In-game description Actual requirements (if different) Gamerscore earned Trophy type (PS)\nPS4 Other\nRainbow Collection Gather all 16 colors of wool.

The theoretical average would be expected at 1 egg every 7.5 minutes (9000 game ticks). ‌In Java Edition 1.21.5 and Bedrock Edition 1.21.70[upcoming], the type of egg being laid depends on the chicken variant; temperate chickens lay normal eggs, cold chickens lay blue eggs, and warm chickens lay brown eggs.\nA fox has a 3% chance of spawning with a normal egg in its mouth, which it drops upon death. Alternatively, a player dropping a food item causes the fox to drop the egg.\nGenerated loot[edit | edit source]\nItem Structure Container Quantity\n[hide]\nChance\nJava Edition and Bedrock Edition\nEgg Trial Chambers Chamber dispenser 4–8 6.9%\nVillage Fletcher's chest 1–3 23.3%\nUsage[edit | edit source]\nCrafting ingredient[edit | edit source]\nName Ingredients Crafting recipe\n[hide]\nDescription\nCake Milk Bucket +\nSugar +\nBrown Egg or\nBlue Egg +\nWheat\n\nEmpty buckets remain in the crafting grid after crafting the cake.[upcoming JE 1.21.5 & BE 1.21.70]\nCake Milk Bucket +\nSugar +\nEgg +\nWheat\n\nEmpty buckets remain in the crafting grid after crafting the cake.\nPumpkin Pie Pumpkin +\nSugar +\nBrown Egg or\nBlue Egg\n\n\n[upcoming JE 1.21.5 & BE 1.21.70]\nPumpkin Pie Pumpkin +\nSugar +\nEgg\n\n\nCombat[edit | edit source]\nPlayers are able to throw eggs and deal knockback to mobs (but not other players‌[JE only][1]‌[until JE Combat Tests]), but no damage is dealt, similar to a snowball. Likewise, throwing eggs at neutral mobs provokes them. Eggs can also be fired from dispensers and are affected by gravity. Eggs thrown through fire or lava in Bedrock Edition catch fire, and set fire to entities they hit.\nSpawning chickens[edit | edit source]\nWhen thrown by a dispenser or by pressing the use button, an egg has a 1⁄8 (12.5%) chance of spawning a chick. If this occurs, there is a 1⁄32 (3.125%) chance of spawning three additional chicks (on average, 1 out of every 256 eggs spawns 4 chicks). In other words, whenever an egg is thrown, there is a 31⁄256 chance of spawning 1 chick and a 1⁄256 chance of spawning four chicks.\n‌In Java Edition 1.21.5 and Bedrock Edition 1.21.70[upcoming], the chick variant depends on which egg variant was thrown; regular eggs hatch temperate chicks, blue eggs hatch cold chicks, while brown eggs hatch warm chicks.\nThe expected value of the number of chicks an egg produces is 35⁄256 or 13.7%. This means that on average, a chick is spawned every 7.3 eggs, a stack of 16 eggs spawns 2.188 chicks, and a full inventory including the hotbar and off-hand (37 × 16 = 592 eggs) is expected to spawn approximately 81 chicks.\nFor the purposes of establishing a new chicken farm with eggs alone, the probability P for at least 2 chicks to spawn after throwing n eggs can be calculated using the following formula:\nP\n=\n1\n−\n(\n7\n8\n)\nn\n−\nn\n×\n1\n8\n×\n3\n1\n3\n2\n×\n(\n7\n8\n)\nn\n−\n1\nWhen throwing 16 eggs, there is a 62% chance of spawning at least two chicks. When throwing 32 eggs, the probability rises to 92%\nAn average of 450 seconds elapses for a chicken to lay another egg. Accounting for all probabilities, the average chicken produces 1.09 chickens per hour when all the eggs it lays are thrown.\nSounds[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition:\nThrown eggs use the Friendly Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n[hide]\nSounds\nSound Subtitles Source Description Resource location Translation key Volume Pitch Attenuation\ndistance\nEgg flies Players When an egg is thrown entity.egg.throw subtitles.entity.egg.throw 0.5 1⁄3-0.5 16\nDispensed item Blocks When a dispenser shoots an egg block.dispenser.launch subtitles.block.dispenser.dispense 1.0 1.2 16\nChicken plops Friendly Creatures When an egg is laid by a chicken entity.chicken.egg subtitles.entity.chicken.egg 1.0 0.8-1.2 16\nBedrock Edition:\n[hide]\nSounds\nSound Source Description Resource location Volume Pitch\nPlayers When an egg is thrown random.bow 0.5 0.33-0.5\nPlayers When a dispenser shoots an egg random.bow 1.0 0.83-1.25\nFriendly Creatures When an egg is laid by a chicken mob.chicken.plop 1.0 0.8-1.2\nData values[edit | edit source]\nID[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition:\nName Identifier Form\n[hide]\nTranslation key\nEgg egg Item\nitem.minecraft.egg\nBlue Egg blue_egg Item\nitem.minecraft.blue_egg\nBrown Egg brown_egg Item\nitem.minecraft.brown_egg\nName Identifier Entity tags\n[hide]\nTranslation key\nThrown Egg egg impact_projectiles\nentity.minecraft.egg\nBedrock Edition:\nName Identifier Numeric ID Form\n[hide]\nTranslation key\nEgg egg 390 Item\nitem.egg.name\nBlue Egg blue_egg 749 Item\nitem.blue_egg.name\nBrown Egg brown_egg 750 Item\nitem.brown_egg.name\nName Identifier Numeric ID\n[hide]\nTranslation key\nEgg egg 82\nentity.egg.name\nEntity data[edit | edit source]\nThrown eggs have entity data that define various properties of the entity.\nJava Edition:\nMain article: Entity format\n[NBT Compound / JSON Object] Entity data\nTags common to all entities[show]\nTags common to all projectiles[show]\n[NBT Compound / JSON Object] Item: The item to render as, may be absent.\nTags common to all items[show]\nBedrock Edition:\nSee Bedrock Edition level format/Entity format.\nAchievements[edit | edit source]\n[hide]\nIcon Achievement In-game description Actual requirements (if different) Gamerscore earned Trophy type (PS)\nPS4 Other\nThe Lie Bake a cake using: wheat, sugar, milk, and eggs.

While worn as torso armor, they allow gliding by pressing jump while midair.

A shulker guards the elytra and the ship's two loot chests.\nUsage[edit | edit source]\nElytra are equipped in the chestplate slot, either by placing the item directly in the slot, by pressing use item while held in hand, or by firing a point-blank dispenser at a target. They are gray in color by default, but they adopt the design of any cape the player is wearing. They maintain their in-world texture design even when they're broken or enchanted.\nFlying[edit | edit source]\nTo fly, the player must press the jump key while falling, and the elytra spread apart like a beetle's wings. The player can aim their view around to turn or adjust their pitch. Losing altitude increases speed, and gaining altitude decreases speed. Firework rockets can be used to increase speed. Additionally, speed is quickly lost from sharp changes in direction.\nThe player can take fall damage while flying unless they land at a shallow angle or a low enough speed. The critical, damaging angle is about 50°. Additionally, colliding with a vertical surface while gliding too fast causes damage to the player and their armor. When a player dies in this way, they receive the death message \"<player> experienced kinetic energy\". Note that colliding with a horizontal surface does not cause this type of damage, so the player takes no damage when flying into a ceiling. The amount of damage caused by a collision is determined by the formula:\ndamage\n=\n1\n0\n×\n(\nchange in horizontal velocity\n)\n−\n3\nA safe and simple cruise with the highest travel distance can be achieved by aiming directly at the horizon while at the glide's altitude limit. The player's speed is slow enough to allow them time to do other things during a long flight, like sort out their inventory.\nIn Creative mode or when the \"mayfly\" ability has been given, the player can alternatively hold the jump key to fly up,‌[Bedrock Edition only] or double press the jump key to move around freely.\nFlight can be stopped by pressing the jump key.‌[Bedrock Edition only]\nSpeed and altitude[edit | edit source]\nElytra have a minimum speed of about 7.2 m/s (obtained by gliding at the altitude cap with a strong upward pitch of 30°). If the diver drops to 0 speed, they quickly get accelerated back up to at least this minimum. The diver can increase speed by choosing to descend faster, but afterward, they do not regain nearly as much altitude. In the real world, drag increases with speed, and drag, in turn, slows the aircraft; Minecraft mimics this. To glide from cliff to cliff, a player's best bet is to aim slightly above the horizon.\nSharp turns are a fast way to lose speed. Quicker turns cause greater losses, while gentle movements have small effects. Making a hairpin turn can actually be used for making high-speed landings safe as well as for precise landings on small targets like rooftops. The player aims to glide just above the target, then as they're right over it they immediately reverse directions, then they make readjustments as necessary.\nThe lowest rate of altitude loss is about 1.5 m/sec, obtained by gliding at the altitude cap with a slight upward pitch (12° or 15°).\nTo get the best possible glide ratio (and thus the furthest distance out of their altitude), the diver pilot should aim directly at the horizon. This ratio is about 9.47 to 1.\nSlow Falling potions greatly decrease the player's vertical (fall) speed, which also greatly decreases their horizontal speed (clearly, it depends on the vertical fall rate, as one might expect from flight modeling). The net result is that the player flies extremely slowly - but their elytra still takes durability damage at the usual rate (1 durability per second without Unbreaking). The Feather Falling enchantment does not affect elytra speed and does not reduce fall damage from hitting things with elytra.\nIt is possible to calculate the glide range by dividing the altitude by tan of the glide angle (altitude/tan(glide angle)). For example, if the player glides from an altitude of 64 blocks above ground with a glide angle of 15 degrees, they can glide for 237 blocks (assume that they are on superflat), since floor(64 / tan(15)) is 237.\nStalling[edit | edit source]\nTrying for too high a pitch reduces the player's lift. At a pitch of 30° above the horizon, the player has the lowest possible airspeed of 7.2 m/sec. Above that, the player might be considered to be in a stall. Increasing the pitch gets closer to a free-fall, and stalled flight at 60° is enough to cause fall damage. Stalling at 90° is a true free-fall.\nRecovering from a stall is done by readjusting to any safe pitch as quickly as the player likes. This can be just changing to look at the horizon.\nPowered flight[edit | edit source]\nFirework rockets are used for speed boosts while gliding.\nFirework rockets can be used for propulsion during flight by placing it in either hand and using. Using a firework rocket while gliding quickly maximizes the player's speed for a time similar to the rocket's flight duration.\nIf the rocket is equipped with firework stars, it explodes at the end of its flight, inflicting damage based on the number of stars.\nIt is possible to gain altitude during powered flight. This makes it possible to glide for extreme distances and had been used extensively by far lands/World Border challenges.\nDurability[edit | edit source]\nA broken pair of elytra.\nDurability decreases by one point each second when gliding. A pair of elytra has 432 durability, allowing 7 minutes and 12 seconds of gliding time without enchantments, providing more than 10,000 blocks of transport distance. It is possible to apply the Unbreaking enchantment using an anvil and an enchanted book, which affects the elytra, in the same way it does to tools. Unbreaking III increases elytra's flight time to about four seconds per durability point, a total of 28 minutes and 48 seconds.\nWhen the durability reaches 1, elytra stop working until they are repaired, adopting a tattered texture in the inventory. The damage ends at durability 1, so they can never fully break.\nRepairing[edit | edit source]\nCombining[edit | edit source]\nIngredients Crafting recipe\n[hide]\nDescription\nDamaged Elytra\n\n\nThe durability of the two pairs are added together, plus extra 21 points of durability.\nIngredients Grinding recipe\n[hide]\nDescription\nDamaged Elytra\nThe durability of the two pairs is added together, plus extra 21 points of durability.\nUnit repair[edit | edit source]\nMain article: Anvil mechanics § Unit repair\nIngredients\n[hide]\nAnvil recipe\nDamaged Elytra +\nPhantom Membrane\nElytra\nA pair of elytra can be repaired in an anvil by adding phantom membranes, with each membrane restoring 25% of the elytra's maximum durability, rounded down.

Issues should be reported and viewed there.\nTrivia[edit | edit source]\nIn reality, elytra are not used for flight. They are the tough forewings of beetles and earwigs that cover the wings they actually use for flight. However, like Minecraft elytra, some beetles can use them for gliding.\nA flying player has a shorter hitbox than usual: A 0.6 block cube centered on the player's feet.\nIn Java Edition if the player glides into deep water with elytra equipped, the animation does not stop, giving it the appearance of a swimming animation.[5] The animation stops once the player touches the ground. Additionally, firework rockets can be used with elytra underwater with a short boost duration.\nElytra do not deactivate when the player flies into lava.[5]\nElytra can be equipped onto some mobs using commands. This has no effect unless the mob has the FallFlying tag set to 1b. Except for squids, mobs glide forward, unable to control the movement before landing, at which time they regain their AI.\nExceptions to this are squids as the squid's AI causes it to attempt swimming in midair, making it fall straight down because it conflicts with the elytra mechanics.\nBecause chickens fall slowly, they can move more distance.\nEndermen, tamed wolves and tamed cats that are not sitting cannot teleport until they hit the ground.\nBecause mobs do not regain control until they hit the ground, vexes fall until they die or despawn as they cannot touch the ground.\nMobs capable of flying, such as parrots or vexes can steer in air, though they cannot travel up or down. Dolphins also have this ability.\n4J Studios created an elytra-centered tutorial map for console edition when elytra were first introduced to this platform, this map is themed as \"ruins of an ancient civilization of Minecraft worshippers\" and showcases the new amplified terrain generation. This map can be seen behind the scenes.[6] On 28 March 2017, 4J Studios added an elytra-themed Mini Games for Legacy Console Edition called \"Glide;\" it consists of Time Attack and Score Attack mode.[7][8]\nA player who jumps with both elytra and the Slow Falling effect travels slightly upward, which is a cheap but time-consuming alternative to fireworks and Riptide-enchanted tridents.\nMojang has considered the suggestion of combining elytra with a chestplate, but eventually decided against it, stating that elytra taking up armor is an intentional decision of game balancing.[9]\nIn Minecraft is turning 15, Zuri can be seen wearing elytra. However, instead of the model, they're wearing the item itself, making the elytra disporportionately small.\nGallery[edit | edit source]\nRenders[edit | edit source]\nWorn[edit | edit source]\nAlex gliding with elytra.\nAri gliding with elytra.\nKai gliding with elytra.\nNoor gliding with elytra.\nSteve gliding with elytra.\nSunny gliding with elytra.\nZuri gliding with elytra.\nEfe gliding with elytra.\nMakena gliding with elytra.\nCapes[edit | edit source]\nOld Mojang cape\nNew Mojang cape\nMojang Studios cape\nCrowdin Translator cape\ndannyBstyle's cape\nJulianClark's cape\nMillionth Customer cape\nMINECON 2011 Attendees cape\nMINECON 2012 Attendees cape\nMINECON 2013 Attendees cape\nMINECON 2015 Attendees cape\nScrapped elytra design for MINECON 2015 cape\nMINECON 2016 Attendees cape\nMINECON Live 2019 Founder's cape\nMojira Moderator cape\nMrMessiah's cape\nPrismarine cape\nRealms mapmaker's cape\nCobalt cape\nScrolls cape\nTurtle cape\nPancape cape\nMigrator cape\nBirthday cape\nValentine cape\nVanilla cape‌[Java Edition only]\nVanilla cape‌[Bedrock Edition only]\nCherry Blossom Cape‌[Java Edition only]\nCherry Cape‌[Bedrock Edition only]\nFollower's Cape ‌[Java Edition only]\nFollower's Cape ‌[Bedrock Edition only]\nPurple Heart Cape ‌[Java Edition only]\nPurple Heart ‌[Bedrock Edition only]\n15th Anniversary Cape ‌[Java Edition only]\n15th Anniversary Cape ‌[Bedrock Edition only]\nMCC Cape ‌[Java Edition only]\nMCC Cape ‌[Bedrock Edition only]\nMinecraft Experience Cape ‌[Java Edition only]\nMinecraft Experience Cape ‌[Bedrock Edition only]\nItem[edit | edit source]\nA pair of enchanted elytra.\nScreenshots[edit | edit source]\nElytra in an end ship.\nA player wearing elytra.\nA player using elytra.\nElytra with only 1 durability.\nA player gliding while blocking with a shield.\nIn other media[edit | edit source]\nScreenshot of Glide mini-games.\nAnother screenshot of Glide mini-games.\nOfficial elytra themed tutorial map.\nArtwork of Steve and Alex using elytra.\nGlide launch poster.\nAri flying with several parrots.\nMakena flying with elytra.\nZuri wearing the elytra item, not the elytra model.\nElytra concept art for A Minecraft Movie.\nReferences[edit | edit source]\n↑ MC-90594\n↑ MC-94060 — Equipping armor/elytra through inventory or dispenser doesn't play sounds — resolved as \"Fixed\".\n↑ MC-277945 — Incorrect verb form in \"Elytra swooshes\" subtitle — resolved as \"Fixed\".\n↑ MC-90212\n↑\na b MC-97190 — While gliding into water or lava, player continues gliding — resolved as \"Works As Intended\".\n↑ \"Learning To Fly\" – minecraft.net.\n↑ \"Glide Mini Game on Consoles Tomorrow\" – minecraft.net, March 23, 2017.\n↑ \"Mini Game Masters Glide onto Console\" – minecraft.net, March 28, 2017.\n↑ \"Part of the tradeoff of having an Elytra is it takes up half your armor.\" – Minecraft Feedback, July 12, 2018.\nExternal links[edit | edit source]\nTaking Inventory: Elytra – Minecraft.net on December 14, 2019\nNavigation[edit | edit source]\n[hide]\nv t e\nTools\nPickaxe Wooden Stone Iron Golden Diamond Netherite\nShovel Wooden Stone Iron Golden Diamond Netherite\nAxe Wooden Stone Iron Golden Diamond Netherite\nHoe Wooden Stone Iron Golden Diamond Netherite\nMiscellaneous Flint and Steel Fishing Rod Carrot on a Stick Warped Fungus on a Stick Shears Brush Elytra\n[hide]\nv t e\nItems\n[hide]\nEquipment\nTools Axe Brush Elytra Fishing Rod Carrot on a Stick Warped Fungus on a Stick Flint and Steel Hoe Pickaxe Shears Shovel\nWeapons Axe Mace Bow Crossbow Shield Sword Trident\nAmmunition Arrow Tipped Arrow Firework Rocket\nJE only Spectral Arrow\nArmor Boots Chestplate Helmet Turtle Shell Horse Armor Leggings Wolf Armor\n[show]\nUtilities\n[show]\nFood\n[show]\nIngredients\n[show]\nCreative or commands only\n[show]\nUnused\n[show]\nUnimplemented\n[show]\nJoke features\n[show]\nRemoved",

There is a 10⁄39 chance to drop an additional 0–1 emeralds, a 5⁄39 chance to drop an additional 2–3, and a 2⁄39 chance to drop an additional 4–5.\nIn Bedrock Edition, with Looting III, it is possible for a vindicator in a raid to drop up to 16 emeralds upon death (vindicator drops + raid drops + an additional drop).\nSource Roll Chance Quantity (Roll Chance)\nDefault Looting I Looting II Looting III\nEvoker 100%[d 1] 0–1 0–2 0–3 0–4\nVindicator 100%[d 1] 0–1 0–2 0–3 0–4\n↑\na b Dropped only when kill credit is given to the player\nGenerated loot[edit | edit source]\nSee also: Emerald Ore § Natural generation\nEmeralds can generate in chests in some village houses or other generated structures.\nItem Structure Container Quantity\n[hide]\nChance\nJava Edition\nEmerald Buried Treasure Chest 4–8 59.9%\nDesert Pyramid Suspicious sand 1 12.5%\nChest 1–3 18%\nDesert well Suspicious sand 1 12.5%\nEnd City Chest 2–6 9%\nIgloo Chest 1 7.6%\nJungle Pyramid Chest 1–3 8.7%\nOcean ruins Warm ruins suspicious sand 1 13.3%\nCold ruins suspicious gravel 1 13.3%\nShipwreck Treasure chest 1–5 73.7%\nTrail Ruins Suspicious gravel 1 4.4%\nTrial Chambers Corridor pot 1–3 35.6%\nOminous Vault 4–10 56.2%\nVault and reward chest 2–4 38.4%\nUnderwater Ruins Big ruins chest 1 14.9%\nSmall ruins chest 1 16.4%\nVillage Tanner's chest 1–4 17.3%\nDesert house chest 1–3 14.3%\nSnowy house chest 1–4 9.9%\nTemple chest 1–4 25.4%\nSavanna house chest 1–4 21.5%\nFletcher's chest 1 12.3%\nButcher's chest 1 10.2%\nPlains house chest 1–4 22.8%\nMason's chest 1 20.8%\nShepherd's chest 1 12.3%\nFisherman's chest 1 24.2%\nTaiga house chest 1–4 18.6%\nArmorer's chest 1 31.8%\nBedrock Edition\nEmerald Desert Pyramid Chest 1–3 18%\nSuspicious sand 1 12.5%\nDesert well Suspicious sand 1 12.5%\nEnd City Chest 2–6 9%\nIgloo Chest 1 7.6%\nJungle Pyramid Chest 1–3 8.7%\nOcean Ruins Cold ruins suspicious gravel 1 13.3%\nWarm ruins suspicious sand 1 13.3%\nShipwreck Treasure chest 1–5 73.7%\nStronghold Altar chest 1–3 7.1%\nTrail Ruins Suspicious gravel 1 4.3%\nTrial Chambers Corridor pot 1–3 35.6%\nOminous Vault 4–10 56.2%\nVault and reward chest 2–4 39.7%\nUnderwater Ruins Big ruins chest 1 14.9%\nSmall ruins chest 1 16.4%\nVillage Desert house chest 1–3 14.3%\nTanner's chest 1–4 17.3%\nTemple chest 1–4 25.4%\nPlains house chest 1–4 22.8%\nFletcher's chest 1 12.3%\nButcher's chest 1 10.2%\nSnowy house chest 1–4 9.9%\nMason's chest 1 20.8%\nTaiga house chest 1–4 20.3%\nShepherd's chest 1 12.3%\nSavanna house chest 1–4 21.5%\nArmorer's chest 1 31.8%\nUsage[edit | edit source]\nTrading[edit | edit source]\nMain article: Trading\nEmeralds are primarily used as currency for trading with villagers and wandering traders.

It is possible for a librarian to sell the same book more than once. The price in emeralds depends on the enchantment level and \"treasure\" status. The minimum price of a book is given by 2 + 3 * (enchantment level), while the maximum price is 6 + 13 * (enchantment level). The possible values are 5–19 emeralds for Lvl I, 8–32 for Lvl II, 11–45 for Lvl III, 14–58 for Lvl IV, and 17–71 for Lvl V. For treasure enchantments the price is doubled. The cost is capped at 64 emeralds. All values below this cap are equally probable.\nThe price ranges between 5-64 emeralds per book. Based on the level of the enchantment and whether it is classified as a \"treasure enchantment\" (meaning they are not obtainable by enchanting, e.g. Mending), which doubles the cost, or not a price is determined.\nCost of enchanted books based on their level\nLevel Lowest price Highest price\nI (1) 5 19\nII (2) 8 32\nIII (3) 11 45\nIV (4) 14 58\nV (5) 17 71 (capped at 64)\nThey may contain any available enchantment (except Soul Speed, Swift Sneak, and Wind Burst) at any available level. See trading notes for more information on enchantments and prices.\nDrops[edit | edit source]\nThis feature is exclusive to Bedrock Edition. \nVindicators and pillagers that spawn from raids have a small chance to drop an enchanted book with a level 30 enchantment, which may be a treasure enchantment.\nEnchanting[edit | edit source]\nAn enchanted book with multiple high level enchantments.\nAn enchanted book with multiple enchantments that can be applied to the same item.\nPlayers can create an enchanted book by enchanting a book on an enchantment table. Books have a decreased chance of getting multiple enchantments (specifically, if multiple enchantments would be added, then one is removed at random), and have a lower \"enchantability level\" than most other items. Treasure enchantments such as Mending cannot be obtained from an enchantment table.\nBartering[edit | edit source]\nPlayers can barter with piglins by using or throwing gold ingots, and doing so has a 5⁄459 chance for piglins to give the player an enchanted book with any level of Soul Speed. Soul Speed enchanted books are obtainable only through bartering or chest loot inside a bastion remnant. They cannot be obtained through enchanting, trading, or fishing.\nUsage[edit | edit source]\nSee also: Anvil mechanics\nIn Survival, enchanted books are the only method to obtain certain enchantments on certain tools, such as Unbreaking on shields. Enchanted books have a shine effect on their sprite.\nTo use an enchanted book, the player must place an item in the first slot in an anvil, and a book in the next. In order to complete the enchantment, the player must have the required amount of experience. Note that using an enchanted book gets significant discounts at the anvil. Enchanted books themselves can be combined to create a single book with increased or multiple enchantments, similar to combining tools or weapons.\nWhen combining items, the compatible enchantments from the book in the second slot are transferred to the item from the first slot, keeping the highest level of any type. If two enchantments have the same level and a higher level is available, they combine into the next level. If a book is applied to an item that can't take all of its spells, the appropriate spells are transferred, while the unusable ones are lost. Enchanted books are single-use.\nEnchanted books do not exhibit their enchantment. For example, a book with Sharpness IV as an enchantment does no more damage than an un-enchanted book, or any non-weapon item, would when used as a weapon. An exception is the Fire Aspect book which can ignite TNT and light campfires and the Fortune book if the block mined can be broken by fist.‌[Bedrock Edition only]\nAvailable items[edit | edit source]\nSee also: Enchantments\nEnchanted books can enchant the usual items that can be enchanted at an enchanting table, but unlike an enchanting table, they are able to boost enchantments such as Sharpness or Thorns to their maximum power, and may apply the following enchantments to items (the table displays only netherite tools and armor, but any type can be enchanted):\nEnchantment Items not enchantable\nat an enchanting table Note\nEfficiency Increases mining speed\nThorns Inflicts damage on attacker\nUnbreaking\n\nIncreasing durability on enchanted tools/armors\nFrost Walker Creates walkable ice layer over water\nMending\n\nUses XP orbs to repair damaged tools/weapons/armors\nCurse of Binding\nPrevents removal of cursed item\nCurse of Vanishing\n\n\n\nCursed item is destroyed upon death\nSoul Speed The wearer's speed is increased when walking on soul sand or soul soil.\nSwift Sneak The wearer's sneaking speed is increased.\nWind Burst A burst of wind is created upon impact.\nCreative mode[edit | edit source]\nThe player can enchant any item with any enchantment in Creative mode, allowing any applied effects to exhibit themselves.‌[Java Edition only] For example, a stick can be enchanted with Silk Touch to allow the player to successfully dig grass blocks. The enchanted item can still be used in Survival mode without any loss of enchantments.\nEnchantments that are normally incompatible are still incompatible; for example, Piercing and Multishot cannot be both applied to the same item, even in Creative mode.\nIf a block is enchanted, it loses the enchantment upon being placed in the world.\nDisenchanting[edit | edit source]\nDisenchanting an enchanted book at a grindstone yields a normal book and some experience depending on the quality of the book. However, just like any other item that can hold enchantments, the Curse of Vanishing and Curse of Binding enchantments cannot be removed from a book.\nChiseled bookshelf[edit | edit source]\nUsing the chiseled bookshelf while having an enchanted book in the main hand puts the book inside the chiseled bookshelf.

There are 10 end crystals in total, two of which are protected in \"cages\" of iron bars. All end crystals respawn one after another as the respawning process of the ender dragon starts.\nObtaining[edit | edit source]\nCrafting[edit | edit source]\nIngredients\n[hide]\nCrafting recipe\nGlass +\nEye of Ender +\nGhast Tear\n\nUsage[edit | edit source]\nHealing the ender dragon[edit | edit source]\nTheir primary purpose is to recharge the health of the ender dragon, who gains a charge from the nearest crystal within a cuboid extending 32 blocks from the dragon in all directions. The dragon is healed 1HP each half-second. If multiple ender dragons are spawned, an end crystal can affect multiple dragons at the same time. Entities and blocks neither obstruct the healing beam nor diminish its power.\nRespawning the ender dragon[edit | edit source]\nHow to arrange end crystals on the exit portal to respawn the ender dragon.\nAs items, end crystals may be placed on bedrock and obsidian, if the two blocks above the bedrock or obsidian block are air or replaceable blocks and no other entities intersect the area. When an end crystal is placed in the End, a fire block is created at the end crystal location. If four are placed on the end exit portal, one on each of the flat sides, the crystals respawn the original end crystals on the obsidian pillars, resurrect the dragon, and then explode. The top of each pillar also explodes, destroying any player-placed blocks. This happens even if TNT explosions are turned off in settings.\nIf the exit portal is ever broken for any reason, end crystals can still be placed on obsidian blocks with the same location as the exit portal.\nExplosions[edit | edit source]\nEnd crystals explode when attacked or damaged in most ways, even by attacks that normally do zero damage. They are not affected by exploding fireworks, and if damaged by an explosion, they disappear instead of exploding.‌[Java Edition only][1] The end crystal's explosion has an explosion strength of 6, the same as a charged creeper. The end crystal's fire often remains after the crystal explodes. Any ender dragon charging from the crystal when it is destroyed takes 10HP damage.\nIn Java Edition, an end crystal's explosion can be blocked by a shield.\nAlthough an ender dragon damages most blocks and entities in its path, it cannot destroy end crystals.\nPlacing water on the end crystal neutralizes the blast effect, but not the damage or knockback.\nEnd crystals with obsidian or bedrock below them do not damage blocks below them when they explode, due to the explosion center being at the bottom of the end crystal.\nIn Bedrock Edition, setting the game rule mobGriefing to false prevents the end crystal from destroying any blocks.\nBeams[edit | edit source]\nThe end crystal shoots a beam at the ender dragon and heals it when the dragon is within range. This beam can be manually created using the command /data merge entity @e[type=end_crystal,limit=1] {BeamTarget:{X:0, Y:0, Z:0}}. The beam can be pointed in any direction, allowing it to mark locations or objects.\nProperties[edit | edit source]\nA baseless end crystal.\nEnd crystals are of two kinds: the ones with a base beneath them are created either by game mechanism or by the /summon command; while the base-less ones are created by players by manually placing the crystal items on top of obsidian or bedrock.\nThe base appears to be made of bedrock, with a crystal hovering over it. While in the End, a crystal continually generates fire at its current position, one block above the base (directly on top of the block the base is embedded in), replacing any other block at that location. This fire is capable of spreading.\nThe end crystal entity is not solid and can be walked through freely. End crystals can be pushed by pistons, but they explode if moved while on fire. Because fire is checked only when an entity moves, end crystals do not normally take damage from their own fire unless moved.\nSounds[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition:\n[hide]\nSounds\nSound Subtitles Source Description Resource location Translation key Volume Pitch Attenuation\ndistance\nExplosion Blocks When an end crystal explodes entity.generic.explode subtitles.entity.generic.explode 4.0 0.56-0.84 16\nBedrock Edition:\n[hide]\nSounds\nSound Source Description Resource location Volume Pitch\nBlocks When an end crystal explodes random.explode 4.0 1.0\nData values[edit | edit source]\nID[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition:\nItem Identifier Form\n[hide]\nTranslation key\nEnd Crystal end_crystal Item\nitem.minecraft.end_crystal\nEntity Identifier\n[hide]\nTranslation key\nEnd Crystal end_crystal\nentity.minecraft.end_crystal\nBedrock Edition:\nItem Identifier Numeric ID Form\n[hide]\nTranslation key\nEnd Crystal end_crystal 637 Item\nitem.end_crystal.name\nEntity Identifier Numeric ID\n[hide]\nTranslation key\nEnd Crystal ender_crystal 71\nentity.ender_crystal.name\nEntity data[edit | edit source]\nEnd crystals have entity data that define various properties of the entity.\nJava Edition:\nMain article: Entity format\n[NBT Compound / JSON Object] Entity data\nTags common to all entities[show]\n[Int Array] beam_target: The block location, as 3 integers, that its beam points to.\n[Byte] ShowBottom: 1 or 0 (true/false) – if true, the end crystal shows the bedrock slate underneath.

Issues should be reported and viewed there.\nTrivia[edit | edit source]\nAccording to Jeb, the reason behind the current crafting recipe using glass as opposed to chorus fruit or any materials introduced in 1.9 is as a means for players to craft end crystals in older worlds that the dragon has already been killed in.[5]\nA historical rendition of the beacon block featured an animated entity within it, which resembled a yellow miniaturized end crystal. The bedrock platform of the end crystal entity would also render below the beacon, though this would normally be hidden within the block below.\nUsing a piston to push an end crystal's fire into an end portal block deletes the end portal block. However, natural portal blocks regenerate if the end crystal is moved.\nGallery[edit | edit source]\nScreenshots[edit | edit source]\nUsing end crystals to respawn the ender dragon.\nAn ender dragon being hit with the \"healing beam\" of an end crystal.\nAn end crystal.\nAn end crystal in the Overworld spawned using /summon.\nEnd crystals respawning the ender dragon.\nA caged end crystal.\nA player trying to respawn the ender dragon.\nIn other media[edit | edit source]\nOfficial artwork of an end crystal, pictured without its base.\nReferences[edit | edit source]\n↑ MC-118429 — End crystals don't explode when destroyed by nearby explosions\n↑ MC-188247 — resolved as \"Fixed\".\n↑ MC-272550 — resolved as \"Fixed\".\n↑ MC-272550 — resolved as \"Fixed\".\n↑ \"The problem is that you need to be able to craft the crystals on worlds in which the dragon has been destroyed already\" – @jeb_ (Jens Bergensten) on X (formerly Twitter), November 18, 2015\nNavigation[edit | edit source]\n[hide]\nv t e\nEntities\n[show]\nMobs\n[hide]\nOther entities\nPlayer Alex Ari Efe Kai Makena Noor Steve Sunny Zuri\nBlocks Falling Blocks Anvil Concrete Powder Dragon Egg Gravel Pointed Dripstone Sand Red Sand Scaffolding Suspicious Gravel Suspicious Sand Primed TNT\nBE & EE only Falling Block Broken Anvil Snow Primed Underwater TNT\nVehicles Bamboo Raft Boat with Chest Minecart with Chest with Command Block with Hopper with TNT\nJava Edition only Minecart with Furnace with Monster Spawner\nProjectiles Fireball Small Dragon Launched Firework Rocket Llama Spit Shot Arrow Tipped Shulker Bullet Thrown Bottle o' Enchanting Thrown Egg Thrown Ender Pearl Thrown Eye of Ender Thrown Snowball Thrown Splash Potion Lingering Potion Thrown Trident Wind Charge Wither Skull\nJava Edition only Shot Spectral Arrow\nBE & EE only Thrown Ice Bomb\nStationary\nobjects Armor Stand End Crystal Leash Knot Painting\nJava Edition only Item Frame Glow\nBE & edu only Camera\nMiscellaneous Area Effect Cloud Evoker Fangs Experience Orb Fishing Bobber Items Lightning Bolt Ominous Item Spawner\nBE & edu only Balloon\nTechnical\nobjects\nJE only Display Block Item Text Interaction Marker\nJoke features Falling Block Gravtater Obsidian Boat Pink Wither Skull\nMentioned Minecart with Dispenser\nRemoved Shot Purple Arrow\n[hide]\nv t e\nItems\n[show]\nEquipment\n[hide]\nUtilities\nAesthetic Armor Stand Item Frame Glow Painting\nBuckets Bucket Water Lava Milk Powder Snow Axolotl Cod Pufferfish Salmon Tadpole Tropical Fish\nBottles Bottle o' Enchanting Glass Bottle Ominous Bottle Potion Lingering Splash Water Bottle\nInformational Book and Quill Written Clock Compass Recovery Map Empty Explorer Name Tag Spyglass\nVehicles Boat with Chest Minecart with Chest with Hopper with TNT\nJE only Minecart with Furnace\nMusic discs 13 cat blocks chirp far mall mellohi stal strad ward 11 wait otherside 5 Pigstep Relic Creator Music Box Precipice\nOther utility Bone Meal Bowl Bundle Dyed Enchanted Book End Crystal Eye of Ender Fire Charge Firework Rocket Goat Horn Lead Saddle Totem of Undying Trial Key Ominous Wind Charge\nBE & EE only Balloon Glow Stick Ice Bomb Medicine Sparkler Super Fertilizer\n[show]\nFood\n[show]\nIngredients\n[show]\nCreative or commands only\n[show]\nUnused\n[show]\nUnimplemented\n[show]\nJoke features\n[show]\nRemoved",

After it is thrown, the ender pearl is consumed, and the player teleports to where it lands, taking 5HP fall damage. Wearing armor enchanted with Protection and/or Feather Falling reduces the damage taken from the ender pearl. If a player dies from fall damage due to throwing an ender pearl, the death message says \"<player> hit the ground too hard\".\nEnder pearls have a small cone of travel; they do not all follow the same path when thrown in the same direction. The direction and velocity of ender pearl throws is slightly randomized. They can travel about 30 blocks‌[Java Edition only]/45 blocks‌[Bedrock Edition only] when thrown straight up, and up to 54 blocks forward when thrown at an optimum launch angle of ~35° (on even ground).\nThe thrower's vertical velocity influences the throw. Hence timing a throw with a jump can increase the throwing range to 42 blocks when thrown straight up and 64 blocks forward at a 35° angle. Throwing while falling significantly decreases the range. Ender pearls collide with all minecart types, boats and end crystals, and travel through nether portals and end portals. Ender pearls that fall into the void disappear, and do not trigger the player to teleport. However, ender pearl entities (instead of dropped items) are not destroyed by lava and teleport the player to the bottom of lava pools/lava oceans.\nEnder pearls have a cooldown of one second before they can be used again. The cooldown is shown in the hotbar by a white overlay on the ender pearl that shrinks and must disappear before the player can use it again. If there are other inventory or hotbar slots containing ender pearls, they are covered with the white overlay as well.[1]\nEnder pearls can be thrown into end gateways to reach the outer islands of the End. They can also be thrown into the exit portal to reach the player's spawn point.\nIf the player throws an ender pearl and then dies while the pearl is in a loaded chunk before impact, the pearl disappears and the player is not teleported; in Java Edition, the pearl does not vanish upon the player's death if the game rule enderPearlsVanishOnDeath is set to false.\nStasis chamber[edit | edit source]\nEnder pearls are affected by bubble columns. An ender pearl can remain afloat on top of an upward bubble column, allowing it to be stored indefinitely‌[Java Edition only]. A mechanism can then be triggered to make the ender pearl hit a solid surface (e.g. by closing a trapdoor), teleporting the thrower back to the setup wherever they are.\nChunk loading[edit | edit source]\nMain article: Chunk § Chunk loading\nAn ender pearl creates a ticket for chunk loading every time it moves into a new chunk, and also periodically every 10 seconds. It loads and ticks the chunk it is in with a ticket level of 31 as entity processing. It also loads a two-chunk wide ring (a 5×5 chunk area centered on the pearl's chunk) around it as lazy chunks, the first ring being block ticking and the second ring being border chunks. The ender pearl continues to load chunks as long as the player who threw it is online, even when that player is in a different dimension. The pearl stops loading chunks when the player logs off, and starts loading chunks again when the player logs in.\nSpawning endermites[edit | edit source]\nAn ender pearl has a 5% chance to spawn an endermite when it lands. This is the only way through which endermites can spawn, without using cheats. The endermite spawns at the player's position when the pearl lands‌[Java Edition only], or at the pearl's landing site‌[Bedrock Edition only].\nCrafting ingredient[edit | edit source]\nName Ingredients\n[hide]\nCrafting recipe\nEye of Ender Blaze Powder +\nEnder Pearl\n\n\nSounds[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition:\nThrown ender pearls use the Friendly Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n[hide]\nSounds\nSound Subtitles Source Description Resource location Translation key Volume Pitch Attenuation\ndistance\nEnder Pearl flies Friendly Creatures When an ender pearl is thrown entity.ender_pearl.throw subtitles.entity.ender_pearl.throw 0.5 1⁄3-0.5 16\nPlayer teleports Players When an ender pearl teleports a player entity.player.teleport subtitles.entity.player.teleport 1.0 1.0 16\nBedrock Edition:\n[hide]\nSounds\nSound Source Description Resource location Volume Pitch\nPlayers When an ender pearl is thrown random.bow 0.5 0.33-0.5\nData values[edit | edit source]\nID[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition:\nItem Identifier Form\n[hide]\nTranslation key\nEnder Pearl ender_pearl Item\nitem.minecraft.ender_pearl\nEntity Identifier\n[hide]\nTranslation key\nThrown Ender Pearl ender_pearl\nentity.minecraft.ender_pearl\nBedrock Edition:\nItem Identifier Numeric ID Form\n[hide]\nTranslation key\nEnder Pearl ender_pearl 422 Item\nitem.ender_pearl.name\nEntity Identifier Numeric ID\n[hide]\nTranslation key\nEnder Pearl ender_pearl 87\nentity.ender_pearl.name\nEntity Data[edit | edit source]\nThrown ender pearls have entity data that define various properties of the entity.\nJava Edition:\nMain article: Entity format\n[NBT Compound / JSON Object] Entity data\nTags common to all entities[show]\nTags common to all projectiles[show]\n[NBT Compound / JSON Object] Item: The item to render as, may be absent.\nTags common to all items[show]\nBedrock Edition:\nSee Bedrock Edition level format/Entity format.\nAchievements[edit | edit source]\n[hide]\nIcon Achievement In-game description Actual requirements (if different) Gamerscore earned Trophy type (PS)\nPS4 Other\nBeam Me Up Teleport over 100 meters from a single throw of an Ender Pearl Throw an ender pearl 100 blocks in any direction 20G Silver\nAdvancements[edit | edit source]\nIcon Advancement In-game description Actual requirements (if different)\nBullseye Hit the bullseye of a Target block from at least 30 meters away Be at least 30 blocks away horizontally when the center of a target is shot with a projectile by the player.\nRemote Getaway Escape the island Enter an end gateway\nHistory[edit | edit source]\n[hide]\nJava Edition Beta\n1.8 Pre-release Added ender pearls along with endermen.\nEnder pearls have no use, but can stack up to 64.\n[hide]\nJava Edition\n1.0.0 Beta 1.9 Prerelease Ender pearls are now less commonly found near bodies of water since endermen now teleport away when in contact with water.

The pearl is not lost if an ender pearl is thrown into a nether portal and the player travels through the portal; the pearl lands and teleports the player as usual.\nIf multiple ender pearls are thrown in succession, the player can be hurt only once from fall damage within about a one-second span.\nGallery[edit | edit source]\nMojang screenshots[edit | edit source]\n\"Sunny and Noor are next to a fully rebuilt Ruined Portal.

More information in Trading.\nIf the cartographer is in the Nether or the End, either spawned or transported, the trades for the map do not unlock. If the world does not generate a particular structure, trades for the map for that structure also do not unlock.\nIn Java Edition, each cartographer sells its own unique explorer map that points to a different location than other cartographers. Purchasing another explorer map from the same cartographer results in the same explorer map. In Bedrock Edition, a cartographer sells explorer maps that point to the nearest unexplored location, regardless of whether it has been previously mapped by another cartographer. After a player explores the location, the cartographer sells a new map. Structures are counted as explored when the player loads the chunks that the structure is in, even if the player never entered the structure.\nIn Bedrock Edition, if cartographer map trades are unlocked in an old world, the game stops ticking.\nGenerated loot[edit | edit source]\nIn contrast to explorer maps, buried treasure maps (Java Edition) or treasure maps (Bedrock Edition) generate in ocean ruins or in shipwrecks.\nItem Structure Container Quantity\n[hide]\nChance\nJava Edition and Bedrock Edition\nBuried Treasure Map Shipwreck Map chest 1 100%\nUnderwater Ruins Small ruins chest 1 41.7%\nBig ruins chest 1 43.5%\nUsage[edit | edit source]\nUnexplored and partially explored maps.\nSee also: Map § Mapping and Map § Map content\nLocating structures[edit | edit source]\nThere are 4 types of explorer maps: ocean, woodland, trial, and buried treasure. These maps differ from a normal map, in that it shows the area's land-water outline, with an orange striated (striped) texture for water[1], and the blank map texture for land. The maps show a section of land that contains an ocean monument, woodland mansion, trial chambers, or buried treasure respectively.\nIf the \"Villager Trade Rebalance\" experiment is enabled, there are 7 additional explorer maps: jungle explorer maps that show a jungle pyramid, swamp explorer maps that show a swamp hut, as well as maps for desert, plains, savanna, snowy and taiga villages.\nThe structure shown may not be the nearest such structure to the player. The structures are displayed as a small icon. If the player icon is smaller than it would be on a normal map, that means the player is a great distance away. When the player is less than 1027 blocks away from the map border, the icon returns to the proper size. When the player reaches the map's area of land (512×512), the map fills in like a normal map.\nThe basic functions of a buried treasure explorer map are similar to that of the others. However, instead of showing the structure icon on the map, it shows a red X instead. The buried treasure chest is located on the same X and Z coordinates as the middle of the X (the player marker may need to be aligned with the bottom of the middle 2×2 pixel square of the X). To locate the chest spot, hold the treasure map with both hands, not in the offhand slot.\nCloning[edit | edit source]\nIngredients Crafting recipe\n[hide]\nDescription\nEmpty Map +\nOcean Explorer Map or\nWoodland Explorer Map or\nBuried Treasure Map or\nTrial Explorer Map or\nPlains Village Map or\nDesert Village Map or\nSavanna Village Map or\nSnowy Village Map or\nTaiga Village Map or\nSwamp Explorer Map or\nJungle Explorer Map\n\n2\n\nThe output has the same map center as the input map, and the same monument, woodland mansion, buried treasure, trial chamber, village[upcoming Trade Rebalance], jungle temple[upcoming Trade Rebalance] or swamp hut[upcoming Trade Rebalance] marker. Cloned maps are stackable.\nThe parts of the world that have already been explored and mapped are copied, and newly explored areas appear on both instances. In Creative mode, cloned explorer maps can be obtained by pick blocking on the explorer map displayed on item frames (the map needs to be out of the player's inventory when using pick block, or else that map moves into the active hotbar slot).\nSounds[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition\n[hide]\nSounds\nSound Subtitles Source Description Resource location Translation key Volume Pitch Attenuation\ndistance\nMap drawn Blocks When an explorer map is edited using a cartography table ui.cartography_table.take_result subtitles.ui.cartography_table.take_result 1.0 1.0 16\nBedrock Edition: None\nData values[edit | edit source]\nID[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition:\nName Identifier Form\n[hide]\nTranslation key\nMap filled_map Item\nitem.minecraft.filled_map\nfilled_map.monument\nfilled_map.mansion\nfilled_map.explorer_jungle\nfilled_map.explorer_swamp\nfilled_map.village_desert\nfilled_map.village_plains\nfilled_map.village_savanna\nfilled_map.village_snowy\nfilled_map.village_taiga\nfilled_map.buried_treasure\nfilled_map.trial_chambers\nBedrock Edition:\nName Identifier Alias ID Numeric ID Form\n[hide]\nTranslation key\nMap filled_map map 358 Item\nitem.map.name\nitem.map.exploration.monument.name\nitem.map.exploration.mansion.name\nitem.map.exploration.jungle_temple.name\nitem.map.exploration.swamp_hut.name\nitem.map.exploration.village_desert.name\nitem.map.exploration.village_plains.name\nitem.map.exploration.village_savanna.name\nitem.map.exploration.village_snowy.name\nitem.map.exploration.village_taiga.name\nitem.map.exploration.buried_treasure.name\nitem.map.exploration.trial_chambers.name\nMetadata[edit | edit source]\nSee also: Bedrock Edition data values\nIn Bedrock Edition, the item Data value distinguishes explorer maps from one another:\n\nDV\n[hide]\nDescription\n0 Map\n2 Map (locator)\n3 Ocean Explorer Map\n4 Woodland Explorer Map\n5 Treasure Map\n6 Locked Map\n7 Snowy Village Map\n8 Taiga Village Map\n9 Plains Village Map\n10 Savanna Village Map\n11 Desert Village Map\n12 Jungle Explorer Map\n13 Swamp Explorer Map\n14 Trial Explorer Map\n\nItem data[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition:\nSee also: Data component format\nAn explorer map differs from a map in that its map_color and item_name components are set.

It is also used to craft an end crystal or an ender chest.\nContents\n1 Obtaining\n1.1 Crafting\n2 Usage\n2.1 Locating strongholds\n2.2 Activating end portals\n2.3 Crafting ingredient\n3 Sounds\n4 Data values\n4.1 ID\n4.2 Entity data\n5 Advancements\n6 Video\n7 History\n7.1 Data history\n8 Issues\n9 Trivia\n10 Gallery\n10.1 Screenshots\n10.2 In other media\n11 External links\n12 References\n13 Navigation\nObtaining[edit | edit source]\nCrafting[edit | edit source]\nIngredients\n[hide]\nCrafting recipe\nBlaze Powder +\nEnder Pearl\n\n\nUsage[edit | edit source]\nLocating strongholds[edit | edit source]\nAn animation of an eye of ender shattering.\nTo locate strongholds (and the end portals they house):\nPressing use while holding an eye of ender causes it to fly approximately 12 blocks in the direction of the nearest stronghold, traveling through any blocks necessary, and leave a trail of purple particles, the same particle effect used for endermen and ender chests.\nThe eye leads to the chunk where a spiral staircase, the first room generated in the stronghold, is located.\nThe center of this entrance staircase is always exactly at the chunk coordinates 4, ~, 4, although the eye of ender leads to chunk coordinates 0, ~, 0 (the northwest corner of the chunk).\nWhile over 12 blocks away from the northwest corner of the staircase chunk, the eye travels upward to offer an easily-visible indication of the horizontal direction the player must travel.\nWhen closer than 12 blocks to the northwest corner of the staircase chunk, the eye travels downward, to indicate the player is above a stronghold and must mine downward.\nAfter two or three seconds of travel, the eye floats in the air briefly, then either falls (becoming collectable again) or shatters in mid-air. The eye has a 20% chance of shattering (80% chance of surviving) per throw. Therefore, throwing it three times has approximately a 50% overall chance to shatter the eye (0.83=51.2%).\nThe eye of ender's flying function works only in the Overworld and only if a stronghold exists or can generate in the world. It does nothing in the Nether, the End, or custom dimensions, unless a structure able to generate in that dimension has been added to the #minecraft:eye_of_ender_located structure tag.\nNote that the eyes may point to an incorrect location if the target chunks were generated with a different biomes map in an older version or through different generation settings.[1]\nActivating end portals[edit | edit source]\nAn end portal activated with eyes of ender.\nOnce an end portal is found, eyes of ender are required to activate it. End portals require a total of 12 eyes of ender in order to activate, though each individual frame-block has a 10% chance of containing an eye of ender when generated. Eyes can be placed in empty end portal frames by pressing use on them until the entire ring of 12 is filled, thereby activating the portal. Because there is a 10% chance of for each individual end portal frame to contain an eye, there is a 1 in 1 trillion chance that every frame will have an eye in it, thereby activating the portal automatically.\nEnd portal pre-filled eyes Collapse\nEyes 0 1 2 3 4 5-12\nExactly 28% 38% 23% 9% 2% <1%\nOr more 100% 72% 34% 11% 3% <1%\nThe probability that a specific number of eyes are generated was calculated using the probability mass function:\npX(k) = P(X = k) =\n(\n1\n2\nk\n)\n⋅\n0\n.\n1\nk\n⋅\n(\n1\n−\n0\n.\n1\n)\n1\n2\n−\nk\nwhere k is the number of eyes and pX(k) is the probability that a particular end portal contains k eyes when it is generated.\nCrafting ingredient[edit | edit source]\nName Ingredients\n[hide]\nCrafting recipe\nEnd Crystal Glass +\nEye of Ender +\nGhast Tear\n\nEnder Chest Obsidian +\nEye of Ender\n\nSounds[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition:\nEyes of ender use the Friendly Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n[hide]\nSounds\nSound Subtitles Source Description Resource location Translation key Volume Pitch Attenuation\ndistance\nEye of Ender falls [sound 1] Friendly Creatures When an eye of ender drops or breaks entity.ender_eye.death[sound 1] subtitles.entity.ender_eye.death[sound 1] 1.3 1.0 16\nEye of Ender shoots Friendly Creatures When an eye of ender is thrown entity.ender_eye.launch subtitles.entity.ender_eye.launch 0.5 1⁄3-0.5 16\nEye of Ender attaches Blocks When an eye of ender is placed in an end portal frame block.end_portal_frame.fill subtitles.block.end_portal_frame.fill 1.0 1.0 16\n↑\na b c MC-98316 — Wrong subtitles caused by missing distinction\nBedrock Edition:\n[hide]\nSounds\nSound Source Description Resource location Volume Pitch\nBlocks When an eye of ender breaks [sound 1] block.itemframe.break ? ?\nPlayers When an eye of ender is thrown random.bow 0.5 0.33-0.5\nBlocks When an eye of ender is placed in an end portal frame block.end_portal_frame.fill 0.3 0.9/1.0/1.1\n↑ MCPE-115646\nData values[edit | edit source]\nID[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition:\nItem Identifier Form\n[hide]\nTranslation key\nEye of Ender ender_eye Item\nitem.minecraft.ender_eye\nEntity Identifier\n[hide]\nTranslation key\nEye of Ender eye_of_ender\nentity.minecraft.eye_of_ender\nBedrock Edition:\nItem Identifier Numeric ID Form\n[hide]\nTranslation key\nEye of Ender ender_eye 433 Item\nitem.ender_eye.name\nEntity Identifier Numeric ID\n[hide]\nTranslation key\nEye of Ender eye_of_ender_signal 70\nentity.eye_of_ender_signal.name\nEntity data[edit | edit source]\nThe purple particles left by eyes of ender have entity data that define various properties of the entity.\nJava Edition:\nMain article: Entity format\n[NBT Compound / JSON Object] Entity data\nTags common to all entities[show]\n[NBT Compound / JSON Object] Item: The item to render as, may be absent.\nTags common to all items[show]\nBedrock Edition:\nSee Bedrock Edition level format/Entity format.\nAdvancements[edit | edit source]\nIcon Advancement In-game description Actual requirements (if different)\nEye Spy Follow an Eye of Ender Enter a stronghold.\nVideo[edit | edit source]\nNote: This video does not mention that eyes of ender can be used to craft ender chests or end crystals.\nHistory[edit | edit source]\n[hide]\nJava Edition\n1.0.0 Beta 1.9 Prerelease 3 Added eyes of ender.\nEyes of ender can be used on a portal block to repair them, but repairing them does nothing.\nBeta 1.9 Prerelease 4 Each eye can now be placed in a portal block or used to hone in on a stronghold. Jeb demonstrated the new uses for an eye in his livestream.[2] An end portal within a stronghold could be seen in the stream with two eyes inserted into blocks.\nIn older worlds with chunks generated before Beta 1.9 Prerelease 3, the eyes may mislead the player to a place where there isn't a stronghold at all. This happens because the eyes lead to where a stronghold should be based on the world seed in the current version, but before Beta 1.9 Prerelease 3 strongholds generated differently based on the seed. Therefore, if the player saved the coordinates the eye traveled to in an old world and generated a new world with the same seed, the player could travel to those same coordinates and find a stronghold.\nBeta 1.9 Prerelease 6 Eyes of ender no longer render like a tool in third person.\nRC1 The throwing sound of eyes of ender has been changed.\n1.3.1 12w21a Eyes of ender can now be used to craft ender chests.\nPriest villagers would buy 2–3 eyes of ender for one emerald.\n12w22a Priest villagers no longer buy eyes of ender, instead sell them for 7–10 emeralds.\n1.6.4 1.6.3 Eyes of ender now lead to strongholds based on the structure data saved in the world file instead of calculating their approximate location via the world seed.

If one travels to this limit, they can see eyes of ender suddenly switching direction.

In Bedrock Edition, 16 firework rockets with the different base colors and the \"small ball\" effect, and a single firework with no explosion are available in the Creative inventory; these all have a flight duration of 1.\nBy crafting the rocket using firework star(s), colors, trail, and explosion effects can be added to the fireworks.\nCrafting[edit | edit source]\nIngredients Crafting recipe\n[hide]\nDescription\nPaper +\nGunpowder\n\n3\n\nWhen crafted without a firework star, the rocket does not have explosion effects. The amount of gunpowder used increases the flight duration to a maximum of three.\nAny Firework Star +\nPaper +\nGunpowder\n\n3\n\nUp to three gunpowder can be used, which increases flight duration. Any remaining spaces can be filled with firework stars to combine various effects. All firework stars explode almost simultaneously when the rocket detonates.\nUsage[edit | edit source]\nLaunching fireworks[edit | edit source]\nA firework rocket can be launched up vertically by using its item on a block. Firework rockets can also be launched from dispensers and crossbows.\nDispenser[edit | edit source]\nUsing firework rockets with a dispenser is different than launching it on a block. The direction the dispenser is facing launches the firework in that direction; for example, if the dispenser is facing downward, the firework goes downward instead of going up.\nCrossbow[edit | edit source]\nA firework rocket can be used as ammunition for crossbows, although it deals damage only if it has an explosion effect. A higher flight duration gives the firework rocket a longer range, and more damage is added per firework star. If shot from a Multishot crossbow, then 3 rockets fire with the same effects. The Piercing enchantment has no effect on firework rockets shot from a crossbow.\nIn Java Edition, if a firework rocket shot from a crossbow hits an entity, the rocket instantly explodes, no matter the flight duration. Attempting to do this in Bedrock Edition, however, results in the firework passing through the entity,[1] so the player must plan where to aim.\nBoosting elytra[edit | edit source]\nNormally, elytra can glide for a short distance, but with the use of fireworks, the player can fly a long distance, gain speed, and take off from the ground. Using a firework rocket while flying with elytra propels the player in the direction they are facing. If the rocket is equipped with a firework star of any kind, the player takes damage when it explodes.\nThe duration of the speed boost depends on the flight duration of the rocket - a higher flight duration means a longer boost.\nElytra flight boost duration per level of firework (somewhat random)\nFirework flight duration Elytra flight boost duration\n1 ~1.17 seconds\n2 ~1.48 seconds\n3 ~2.22 seconds\nVillage raids[edit | edit source]\nAfter successfully defending a village from a raid, the villagers may celebrate by setting off firework rockets.\nBehavior[edit | edit source]\nSee also: Firework Star § Effects\nOnce launched, fireworks fly out vertically, with random horizontal offset up to 5 blocks. Fireworks can fly in any of the 6 directions a dispenser can point. After some time, the firework explodes into a colorful explosion based on the effects of the firework stars added upon crafting, or no explosion if no firework star was used. If multiple firework stars were added to the rocket upon crafting, they all explode simultaneously.\nThe explosion of a firework rocket deals damage to mobs and players that are within 5 blocks and not obstructed by solid blocks. The maximum damage of a rocket with one firework star is 7HP, with the damage decreasing with distance. Each additional firework star on the rocket adds 2HP points of damage, for a maximum damage of 19HP × 9.5 with 7 stars. Using commands to add additional firework stars results in more damage. The damage dealt is unaffected by any other ingredients used. The explosion does not destroy end crystals, item frames, or paintings, but does destroy armor stands and decorative pots.\nThere is a delay between the detonation and the player hearing the sound, emulating real fireworks, but this sound travels much more slowly than in the real world.[2][3] In Java Edition, the explosion of a firework can be seen 64 blocks away, regardless of its height. In Bedrock Edition, the explosion can be seen from the player's render distance.\nIf the explosion exceeds the particle limit of 16,384, the oldest particles are removed before displaying new ones, resulting in severely diminished firework quality / duration. At most a firework should have 3 trail stars, more than that could waste diamonds, firework stars, and other fireworks. Particle counts per star are:\nBall type Plain Trail\nSmall 98 ~1300\nLarge 387 4000+\nStar 122 ~1600\nCreeper 266 ~3500\nBurst 72 ~930\nTwinkle effect adds 2 particles to the count.\nLike most other entities, fireworks can be moved by water and explosions, and teleported via portals. They also cannot move through solid surfaced blocks: upon hitting one, they either move to a side or explode based on the duration. If a firework explodes under a block, its explosion is flattened.\nNon-lethal fireworks and fireworks crafted with firework stars behave differently around terrains. Lethal fireworks when shot at a solid block explode immediately upon impact, while non-lethal fireworks glide on whatever surface they encounter along their paths for the remainder of their duration and may resume their original trajectories upon exiting the surface.\nDuration and direction[edit | edit source]\nFireworks travel different heights based on the amount of gunpowder added. The number is displayed as a tag on the item's tooltip with the description of \"Flight Duration\".\nEach firework determines its lifetime in ticks by 10 × (number of gunpowder + 1) + random value from 0 to 5 + random value from 0 to 6, after which it explodes.\nWhen spawned by player or command, the height it rises is between 8 and 20 blocks with 1 gunpowder, 18 to 34 blocks with 2 gunpowder, and 32 to 52 blocks with 3 gunpowder. (Note: In Java Edition, it is possible to use commands to create firework rockets with higher durations. These rockets go higher and keep accelerating with virtually no terminal velocity. If the duration is long enough, the firework rocket could reach heights of over 1,000,000 blocks and speeds of over 10,000 m/s in a matter of minutes. Such fireworks with significant X and Z motions speed up sideways exponentially and reach outside the world boundary in a matter of seconds.)\nWhen spawned, fireworks have a vertical speed of .05 and a random small X and Z speed (random value near zero with a standard deviation of .001). Each tick, the firework accelerates horizontally by multiplying its X and Z velocities by 1.15, and vertically by adding a constant factor of 0.04.\nWhen shot from a dispenser, it travels 9 to 10 blocks with 1 gunpowder, 14 to 15 blocks with 2 gunpowder, and 19 to 20 blocks with 3 gunpowder in the direction it was dispensed. When dispensed, the firework has a random velocity close to 0.5 (with a maximum deviation of .009) in the direction it was dispensed and a random small velocity in both other directions (random value near zero with a maximum deviation of .009). The firework's velocity does not change over the lifetime of the rocket.\nFireworks can be made to travel different directions by being dispensed or launched under flowing water. The firework's direction combines with the flow of the water to go diagonally. The direction changes significantly less if the firework is shot by a dispenser instead of by hand.\nSounds[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition:\nFirework rockets use the Friendly Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n[hide]\nSounds\nSound Subtitles Source Description Resource location Translation key Volume Pitch Attenuation\ndistance\nFirework blasts Ambient/Environment When a non-large firework rocket explodes within a 16-block radius of the player entity.firework_rocket.blast subtitles.entity.firework_rocket.blast 20.0 0.95-1.05 16\nFirework blasts Ambient/Environment When a non-large firework rocket explodes greater than 16 blocks away from the player entity.firework_rocket.blast_far subtitles.entity.firework_rocket.blast 20.0 0.95-1.05 16\nFirework blasts Ambient/Environment When a large firework rocket explodes within a 16-block radius of the player entity.firework_rocket.large_blast subtitles.entity.firework_rocket.blast 20.0 0.95-1.05 16\nFirework blasts Ambient/Environment When a large firework rocket explodes greater than 16 blocks away from the player entity.firework_rocket.large_blast_far subtitles.entity.firework_rocket.blast 20.0 0.95-1.05 16\nFirework twinkles Ambient/Environment When a twinkle firework rocket explodes within a 16-block radius of the player entity.firework_rocket.twinkle subtitles.entity.firework_rocket.twinkle 20.0 0.9-1.05 16\nFirework twinkles Ambient/Environment When a twinkle firework rocket explodes greater than 16 blocks away from the player entity.firework_rocket.twinkle_far subtitles.entity.firework_rocket.twinkle 20.0 0.9-1.05 16\nFirework launches Ambient/Environment When a dispenser shoots, a player uses, or a crossbow fires a firework rocket entity.firework_rocket.launch subtitles.entity.firework_rocket.launch 3.0 1.0 16\nFirework launches Friendly Creatures When a dispenser fires a firework rocket entity.firework_rocket.shoot subtitles.entity.firework_rocket.launch 1.0 1.2 16\nBedrock Edition:\n[hide]\nSounds\nSound Source Description Resource location Volume Pitch\nAmbient/Environment When a non-large firework rocket explodes firework.blast 1.0 1.0\nAmbient/Environment When a large firework rocket explodes firework.large_blast 1.0 1.0\nAmbient/Environment When a twinkle firework rocket explodes firework.twinkle 1.0 1.0\nAmbient/Environment When a dispenser shoots, a player uses, or a crossbow fires a firework rocket firework.launch 1.0 1.0\nAmbient/Environment Unused sound event firework.shoot 1.0 1.0\nData values[edit | edit source]\nID[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition:\nItem Identifier Form\n[hide]\nTranslation key\nFirework Rocket firework_rocket Item\nitem.minecraft.firework_rocket\nEntity Identifier\n[hide]\nTranslation key\nFirework Rocket firework_rocket\nentity.minecraft.firework_rocket\nBedrock Edition:\nItem Identifier Alias ID Numeric ID Form\n[hide]\nTranslation key\nFirework Rocket firework_rocket fireworks 519 Item\nitem.fireworks.name\nEntity Identifier Numeric ID\n[hide]\nTranslation key\nFirework Rocket fireworks_rocket 72\nentity.fireworks_rocket.name\nItem data[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition:\nSee also: Data component format\n[NBT Compound / JSON Object] components: the item's components tag.\n[NBT Compound / JSON Object] minecraft:fireworks\n[NBT List / JSON Array] explosions: List of the explosion effects caused by this firework rocket.

In Bedrock Edition, a naturally spawned drowned has a 0.85% chance to spawn with a fishing rod, while a converted drowned has a 1% chance to spawn with it. If killed, they have an 8.5% chance of dropping this fishing rod. That chance increases by 1% for each level of Looting applied to a weapon (up to 11.5% chance). The dropped item is damaged and never enchanted.\nGenerated loot[edit | edit source]\nItem Structure Container Quantity\n[hide]\nChance\nJava Edition\nEnchanted Fishing Rod[A] Underwater Ruins Small ruins chest 1 41.7%\nBig ruins chest 1 21.7%\nBedrock Edition\nEnchanted Fishing Rod[A] Underwater Ruins Small ruins chest 1 41.7%\nBig ruins chest 1 21.7%\n↑\na b All enchantments are equally probable, including treasure enchantments (except Soul Speed, Swift Sneak, and Wind Burst), and any level of the enchantment is equally probable.\n\nCrafting[edit | edit source]\nIngredients\n[hide]\nCrafting recipe\nStick +\nString\n\nFishing[edit | edit source]\nMain article: Fishing\nEnchanted fishing rods are obtainable through fishing, with a 0.8% chance per attempt while unenchanted ones are obtainable with a 0.2% chance per attempt.

The enchantments are never treasure enchantments.\nCarrot/warped fungus on a stick[edit | edit source]\nIf a carrot on a stick or a warped fungus on a stick is used to the point of zero durability, it becomes a fishing rod again.\nUsage[edit | edit source]\nFishing[edit | edit source]\nMain article: Fishing\nFishing rods can be cast into water. After a short period of time, a stream of bubble particles approaches the fishing rod. If the rod is reeled in once the particles \"bite\" the bobber, the player obtains a fish, junk, or possibly a treasure item. If the fishing rod was in the player's hand and is no longer, the fishing bobber entity despawns, unless the fishing rod to the off-hand or it has been swapped with another fishing rod.[citation needed]\nCrafting ingredient[edit | edit source]\nName Ingredients Crafting recipe\n[hide]\nDescription\nCarrot on a Stick Fishing Rod or\nDamaged Fishing Rod +\nCarrot\n\nThe fishing rod must be diagonally above the carrot to craft the carrot on a stick.\nWarped Fungus on a Stick Fishing Rod or\nDamaged Fishing Rod +\nWarped Fungus\n\nCrafting from a damaged fishing rod is available only in Bedrock Edition. Java Edition requires an unused fishing rod.\nHooking mobs and other entities[edit | edit source]\nSee also: Fishing § Fishing rod durability\nThe fishing rod can be used to hook mobs, items‌[Java Edition only] and some entities, including players. The fishing rod can then be reeled in, dragging the hooked object toward the player without dealing damage. Reeling in a mob or entity costs 5 points of durability, and reeling in an item costs 3 points. Reeling a mob pulls it toward the player with a speed of 1⁄10 the distance between mob and player. Hooking entities in Bedrock Edition with a flaming bobber cast through fire or lava can ignite the entity.\nThe maximum distance the player can get between the bobber and themselves is 33 blocks. A hooked entity that exceeds this distance detaches from the bobber.\nMultiple players can hook the same entity, and when multiple players reel in the entity at the same time, it flies a larger distance than normal.\nBesides mobs and items, entities that can be reeled in include:\nBoats\nBoat with Chests\nMinecarts of any type\nArmor Stands\nShulker Bullets\nFireballs\nPrimed TNT\nAny falling block such as:\nSand\nGravel\nDragon Eggs\nConcrete Powder\nScaffolding\nSnow ‌[Bedrock Edition only]\nAnvils\nSome entities can be hooked, but cannot be reeled in:\nMobs riding/being ridden by other mobs (in Bedrock Edition, the hooked mob dismounts)\nPaintings\nItem Frames ‌[Java Edition only]\nLead knots\nEnd Crystals\nShulkers\nAttempting to reel in said entities still costs durability to the rod.\nAny other entities cannot be hooked at all.\nFuel[edit | edit source]\nA fishing rod can be used as fuel in furnaces, smelting 1.5 items per fishing rod, regardless of its durability.\nOther usage[edit | edit source]\nThe hook can also be used to activate wooden pressure plates or weighted pressure plates.\n\nRepairing[edit | edit source]\nCombining[edit | edit source]\nIngredients Crafting recipe\n[hide]\nDescription\nDamaged Fishing Rod\n\n\nThe durability of the two fishing rods is added together, plus an extra 5% durability.\nIngredients Grinding recipe\n[hide]\nDescription\n2× Damaged Fishing Rod\nThe durability of the two fishing rods is added together, plus an extra 5% durability.\nUnit repair[edit | edit source]\nMain article: Anvil mechanics § Unit repair\nIngredients\n[hide]\nAnvil recipe\nDamaged Fishing Rod\nFishing Rod\nA fishing rod can be combined with another fishing rod in an anvil, preserving the enchantments of both.\nEnchantments[edit | edit source]\nA fishing rod can receive the following enchantments:\nName Description Max level Method Weight\nLure[note 1] Decreases the wait time for hooking.

Flint and steel cannot light end portals.\nUsing flint and steel on TNT ignites it. The explosion damage dealt by TNT ignited with flint and steel in this specific way counts as the player's attack. If the player is sneaking, a fire is instead placed on the side of the TNT the flint and steel was used on.\nA flint and steel can be used on a creeper or charged creeper to force it to explode. Explosions initiated in this way cannot be cancelled.\nWhen powered, a dispenser containing flint and steel can place fires or ignite relevant blocks such as TNT or campfires in the space directly in front of it. This reduces the flint and steel's durability. A dispenser containing a flint and steel cannot detonate creepers.\nRepairing[edit | edit source]\nCombining[edit | edit source]\nIngredients Crafting recipe\n[hide]\nDescription\nDamaged Flint and Steel\n\n\nThe durability of the two flint and steels is added together, plus an extra 3 points of durability.\nIngredients Grinding recipe\n[hide]\nDescription\n2× Damaged Flint and Steel\nThe durability of the two flint and steels is added together, plus an extra 3 points of durability.\nUnit repair[edit | edit source]\nMain article: Anvil mechanics § Unit repair\nIngredients\n[hide]\nAnvil recipe\nDamaged Flint and Steel\nFlint and Steel\nA flint and steel can be combined with another flint and steel in an anvil, preserving the enchantments of both.\nEnchantments[edit | edit source]\nFlint and steel can receive the following enchantments:\nName Description Max level Method Weight\nUnbreaking Grants a chance to negate durability consumption.

    "title": "Food",
    "content": "For food in Minecraft Dungeons, see MCD:Food.\nA player eating a cooked porkchop in Bedrock Edition (third-person front view).\nA player eating bread in Java Edition (first-person view).\nFood refers to any consumable items that, when eaten, restore hunger points and hunger saturation points, and sometimes cause status effects. They are essential for survival, as going without them eventually causes the player to starve, causing damage until reaching 10HP on Easy, 1HP on Normal, or until the player dies on Hard difficulty.\nFood is eaten by holding use while having the food item selected in the hot bar or in the off-hand. Eating (or drinking) a consumable takes approximately 1.6 seconds, with the exception of dried kelp, which takes half of the time. Only cake cannot be eaten this way, and must instead be placed on a surface before being eaten.\nWith the exception of chorus fruit, golden apples, enchanted golden apples, honey bottles, and suspicious stew, food cannot be eaten when the hunger bar is completely full. In Creative mode, any food can be consumed at any time.\nAll food items and ingredients can be stacked in the inventory slots, except for rabbit stew, mushroom stew, beetroot soup, suspicious stew, and cake.‌[Java Edition only]\nThis page covers food items for players. Blocks and items that can be eaten by other mobs, such as wolves are covered on their respective pages.\nContents\n1 Hunger and saturation\n1.1 Usage\n1.2 Nourishment value\n2 Foods\n2.1 Ingredients\n3 Sounds\n4 Achievements\n5 Advancements\n6 History\n7 Issues\n8 Gallery\n8.1 Mojang screenshots\n9 Trivia\n10 References\n11 Navigation\nHunger and saturation[edit | edit source]\nMain article: Hunger § Mechanics\nSee also: Tutorial:Hunger management\nRaw (left) and cooked (right) chicken. Eating raw chicken can give the player food poisoning.\nPlayers have two different food statistics, one of which is visible: The hunger level is visible, and the saturation level is not.\nSaturation is the first statistic to decrease when a player performs energy-intensive actions, and it must be completely depleted before the visible hunger meter begins decreasing. Although the current saturation level is generally hidden, the player can tell that their saturation level is completely depleted if the visible hunger meter begins displaying a jittering effect.\nEating a food item replenishes a fixed number of hunger points and saturation points, based on the item. Some foods have a better ratio of saturation to hunger points replenished than others. Overeating the hunger bar does not overflow to saturation.\nA player's current saturation level can never exceed their current hunger level. A player at a hunger level of 5, for example, can be at a maximum of 5 saturation. Food always restores hunger (raising the saturation limit) before supplying saturation. The most efficient use of food is to eat low-saturation food to fill the hunger bar, followed by high-saturation food to fill saturation. While a few hunger points may be wasted when eating nourishing food when nearly full, eating nourishing foods on a low hunger bar wastes even more points of saturation. Maximizing saturation increases the length of time (and/or the amount of damage healed) before the player needs to eat again.\nUsage[edit | edit source]\nAny food, except cake, can be eaten by hand, by using the food item in the main hand. It takes 1.61 seconds to eat most foods by hand. Although, dried kelp only takes 0.865 seconds to eat by hand. A player can hold food in their offhand in Java Edition, and use.\nEating food by hand causes food particles to spew from the player's mouth, and produces a munching noise. The particles correlate with the respective food item. Eating also slows the user significantly.\nCake has to be eaten by placing it, then right-clicking on its block form. Eating a slice of cake is instant, and each cake has 7 edible slices. The cake becomes thinner as each slice is removed.\nNourishment value[edit | edit source]\nNourishment is defined as the ratio of saturation to hunger points restored. Foods with higher nourishment values should be eaten when the hunger bar is more full.\nThe nourishment table below can help by categorizing foods by their saturation-to-hunger restoration ratios. See the more detailed Foods table for the exact hunger and saturation statistics of each food.\nNourishment Value Food\nSupernatural 2.4 Enchanted Golden Apple, Golden Apple, and Golden Carrot\nGood 1.6 Cooked Mutton, Cooked Porkchop, Cooked Salmon, and Steak\nNormal 1.2 Baked Potato, Beetroot, Beetroot Soup, Bread, Carrot, Cooked Chicken, Cooked Cod, Cooked Rabbit, Mushroom Stew, and Rabbit Stew, and Suspicious Stew\nLow 0.6 Apple, Chorus Fruit, Dried Kelp[note 1], Melon Slice, Poisonous Potato, Potato, Pumpkin Pie, Raw Beef, Raw Chicken, Raw Mutton, Raw Porkchop, Raw Rabbit, and Sweet Berries[note 2]\nPoor 0.2 Cake, Cookie, Dried Kelp[note 2], Glow Berries, Honey Bottle, Pufferfish, Raw Cod, Raw Salmon, Rotten Flesh, Spider Eye, Sweet Berries[note 1], and Tropical Fish\nFoods[edit | edit source]\nName Icon Food points Saturation Effect(s)\n[hide]\nSource(s)\nRestored Quality\n[note 3] Ratio\nApple\n4 () 2.4 6.4 0.6 None\nDestroyed/despawned oak or dark oak leaves\nStronghold altar and storeroom, village weaponsmith and plains house, igloo and bonus chests\nReceive 4 for 1 emerald at apprentice-level trade of farmer villager\nBaked Potato\n5 () 6 11 1.2 None Cooking a potato in a furnace, smoker, or campfire\nTrial Spawner in Trial Chambers.\nBeetroot\n1 () 1.2 2.2 1.2 None\nHarvesting beetroot crops\nFarmer villager who drop beetroot after harvesting beetroot crop\nBeetroot Soup\n6 () 7.2 13.2 1.2 None\nCrafting a bowl together with beetroots\nvillage snowy tundra house chest\nBread\n5 () 6 11 1.2 None\nCrafting from wheat\nMonster room, stronghold altar and storeroom, village, mineshaft, woodland mansion and bonus chests\nReceive 6 for 1 emerald at novice-level trade of farmer villager\nFarmer villager who drop bread after harvesting wheat\nRaid gift from farmer villager‌[Java Edition only]\nCake (slice)\n2 () 0.4 2.4 0.2 None Consume one slice of cake\nCake (whole)\n14 ( × 7) 2.8 16.8 0.2 None\nCrafting from wheat, eggs, sugar, and milk\nReceive 1 for 1 emerald at expert-level trade of farmer villager\nBuried treasure chest‌[Bedrock Edition only]\nTrial chamber intersection chests\nCarrot\n3 () 3.6 6.6 1.2 None\nKilling zombies\nHarvesting carrot crops\npillager outpost and Shipwreck supply chest\nbonus chest‌[Bedrock Edition only]\nFarmer villager who drop carrot after harvesting carrot crop\nChorus Fruit\n4 () 2.4 6.4 0.6 The player may be teleported randomly, as described at Enderman § Teleportation.

Throwing a splash potion or a lingering potion does not return a glass bottle, but brewing a lingering potion gives back a glass bottle.\nMud[edit | edit source]\nUsing a water bottle, splash water bottle or lingering water bottle on dirt, coarse dirt, or rooted dirt transform it into a mud block, at the same time leaving the player with an empty glass bottle.\nCauldrons[edit | edit source]\nUsing a water bottle (or, in Bedrock Edition, a potion, splash potion, or lingering potion) on a cauldron that is not yet full adds that liquid to the cauldron, leaving the player with an empty glass bottle.\nUsage[edit | edit source]\nGlass bottles can be filled to make water bottles, which can then be used to brew items with a brewing stand. Glass bottles are also used to hold the resulting potion.\nCollecting liquids[edit | edit source]\nWater[edit | edit source]\nA bottle may be filled with water by holding it in the hand and using it on a water source block or a cauldron that has water in it. It can also be filled using a waterlogged block.‌[Java Edition only][1]\nAlso, a bottle may be filled by powering a dispenser containing a bottle and pointed at a water source block. This does not work with cauldrons.[2]\nIf filled via a water source, the water is unaffected. If filled via a cauldron, 1⁄3 of the water in the cauldron is removed. Therefore, using a cauldron to fill water bottles is inefficient, except in the Nether where it is normally the only way to fill bottles.\nPotion[edit | edit source]\nIn Bedrock Edition, a bottle may be filled with potion by using it on a cauldron containing potion. When the bottle is filled, 1⁄3 of the cauldron's potion is removed.\nHoney[edit | edit source]\nIf a bee nest or beehive is full, the player can use a glass bottle on the block, or may power a dispenser that contains a bottle and is pointed at the block, which empties the block and creates a honey bottle. Honey bottles can also be emptied by using them in crafting recipes (such as sugar or honey block). However, a lingering potion use on tipped arrow recipe does not give the bottle back.\nDragon's breath[edit | edit source]\nUsing a glass bottle in clouds emitted when the ender dragon breathes or shoots a dragon fireball fills the bottle with dragon's breath.\nWhen put 2 or more dragon's breath in the brewing stand, after the brewing process, a glass bottle drops as an entity. However, if put only 1 dragon's breath in the brewing stand, after the brewing process, the glass bottle is consumed and cannot be retrieved.[3]\nTrading[edit | edit source]\nVillager Probability Villager wants Player receives\nJE BE\nExpert Cleric 67% 50% 9 × Glass Bottle Emerald\nCrafting ingredients[edit | edit source]\nName Ingredients\n[hide]\nCrafting recipe\nHoney Bottle Glass Bottle +\nHoney Block\n\n4\n\nSounds[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition\n[hide]\nSounds\nSound Subtitles Source Description Resource location Translation key Volume Pitch Attenuation\ndistance\nBottle fills Blocks When a bottle is filled with a liquid from a cauldron, or honey from a bee nest or beehive item.bottle.fill subtitles.item.bottle.fill 1.0 1.0 16\nBottle fills Friendly Creatures When a bottle is filled with water from a water source item.bottle.fill subtitles.item.bottle.fill 1.0 1.0 16\nBottle empties Blocks When a water bottle is emptied item.bottle.empty subtitles.item.bottle.empty 1.0 1.0 16\nBottle fills Friendly Creatures When a bottle is filled with dragon's breath item.bottle.fill_dragonbreath subtitles.item.bottle.fill 1.0 1.0 16\nBedrock Edition:\n[hide]\nSounds\nSound Source Description Resource location Volume Pitch\nBlocks When water from a bottle is placed in a cauldron[sound 1] cauldron.fillwater 0.1 1.0\nBlocks When water from a bottle is taken from a cauldron[sound 1] cauldron.takewater 0.1 1.0\nBlocks When a bottle is filled with a potion from a cauldron[sound 1] cauldron.fillpotion 0.1 1.0\nBlocks When a potion bottle is emptied into a cauldron[sound 1] cauldron.takepotion 0.1 1.0\nSound When a bottle is emptied bottle.empty 1.0 1.0\nSound When a bottle is filled bottle.fill 1.0 1.0\nBlocks When a bottle is filled with honey from a bee nest or beehive[sound 2] bucket.fill_water 1.0 1.0\nSound When a bottle is filled with dragon's breath bottle.dragonbreath 1.0 1.0\n↑\na b c d MCPE-174867\n↑ MCPE-53881\nData values[edit | edit source]\nID[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition:\nName Identifier Form\n[hide]\nTranslation key\nGlass Bottle glass_bottle Item\nitem.minecraft.glass_bottle\nBedrock Edition:\nName Identifier Numeric ID Form\n[hide]\nTranslation key\nGlass Bottle glass_bottle 427 Item\nitem.glass_bottle.name\nAchievements[edit | edit source]\n[hide]\nIcon Achievement In-game description Actual requirements (if different) Gamerscore earned Trophy type (PS)\nPS4 Other\nBee our guest Use a Campfire to collect Honey from a Beehive using a Bottle without aggravating the bees. — 15 Bronze\nLocal Brewery Brew a potion.

This yields one bunch of glow berries when the vine is bearing them and nothing when it is not. A cave vine also breaks if water runs over its location or if a piston extends or pushes a block into its location.\nFortune has no effect on the number of glow berries dropped.\nUsage[edit | edit source]\nPlacement[edit | edit source]\nGlow berries can be placed on and grown from the bottom of most blocks (any block whose bottom face covers the bottom of the entire block). They can also be placed on the bottom of a cave vine, extending the stack of vines by 1 block. They have no specific lighting requirements.\nGrowth[edit | edit source]\nPlacing glow berries on the bottom of a block creates a cave vine that grows downward one block at a time as long as air is beneath it and its maximum height (2 to 26 blocks) has not been reached.\nFarming[edit | edit source]\nCave vines are functionally a crop, and glow berries are its seeds. However, it grows differently than farmland crops do. In Bedrock Edition, cave vines is technically an item on its own. In Java Edition there is no proper cave vines item, and glow berries is the closest thing to its item form.\nEach newly-grown cave vine block has an 11% chance of bearing glow berries. Glow berries only grow on a newly produced cave vine, and only when it first grows. A cave vine bearing no berry does not naturally grow a berry, unlike sweet berry bushes ‌[Java Edition only][more information needed].\nUsing bone meal on a cave vine produces a glow berry in the vine, if the vine was not bearing glow berries.\nCave vines stop growing if shears are used on the bottom block of the stack.\nIn Bedrock Edition, in the Nether, cave vines can grow and bear glow berries.\nThe different types of cave vines actually have different block names and ids. Futhermore, there are 3 different item versions of the cave vines blocks in Bedrock Edition.\nFood[edit | edit source]\nTo eat glow berries, press and hold use while it is selected in the hotbar. Eating one restores 2 () hunger and 0.4‌[JE only] / 1.2‌[BE only] hunger saturation, like sweet berries.\nLight[edit | edit source]\nWhen bearing glow berries, cave vines give off a light level of 14.\nComposting[edit | edit source]\nPlacing glow berries into a composter by using them on it has a 30% chance of raising the compost level by 1.\nBreeding[edit | edit source]\nGlow berries can be fed to foxes to breed them.\nGlow berries can be used on baby foxes to reduce the time until they grow by 10%.\nSounds[edit | edit source]\nGlow berries[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition:\n[hide]\nv t

These include stone, coal ore, copper ore, iron ore, emerald ore, log, or packed ice. Goats do not ram other solid blocks. In Java Edition, these blocks are listed under the snaps_goat_horn tag, and can be modified by data packs.\nUp to two horns can be dropped from an adult goat, or one horn if the goat spawned with only one horn. Regular goats may drop the \"Ponder\", \"Sing\", \"Seek\", and \"Feel\" horns, while screaming goats drop the \"Admire\", \"Call\", \"Yearn\", and \"Dream\" horns.

If the pickaxe is enchanted with Fortune, it has a 33.3% chance to multiply the drops by 2, Fortune II has a 25% chance to multiply the drops by 2 or 3 and Fortune III has a 20% chance each to multiply the drops by 2, 3, or 4 for a maximum possible drop of 24 golden nuggets. The average drop rate for a Fortune III pickaxe is 8.8, while the drop rate for a Silk Touch pickaxe is a single ingot, or a flat rate of 9. It is slightly more efficient to mine with a Silk Touch pickaxe.\nGilded blackstone mined using a pickaxe has a 10% chance to drop 2-5 gold nuggets. If the pickaxe is enchanted with Fortune I, the chance gold nuggets drop is increased 14.29%, Fortune II increases the drop chance to 25%, and Fortune III guarantees the drop.\nUsage[edit | edit source]\nGold nuggets can be used to craft a golden carrot or glistering melon for brewing. Also, gold nuggets can be combined with gunpowder and dye to create a firework star that bursts in a star-shaped explosion.\nPiglins instantly pick up any gold nuggets that are within 1 block of them.

This costs 1 point of durability.\nWeapon[edit | edit source]\nWhen used as a weapon, a golden axe loses 2 durability points.\nJava Edition[edit | edit source]\nAttacking a shield user with an axe disables the use of the shield for 5 seconds. Vindicators, piglin brutes, or other mobs with commands always disable the player's shield. Damage done when using an axe as a weapon is more than that of a sword of the same tier, though they take longer than a sword to recover, resulting in lower DPS.\nAttack damage Attack speed Recovery time DPS Lifetime damage inflicted[note 1]\n7HP 1.0 1 second (20 game ticks) 7.0 112HP × 56\n↑ The formula to find the total lifetime damage is ceil(durability ÷ 2) × damage per hit. The durability is halved then ceiled because axes take double durability when used as a weapon, and the last 1 durability can also deal damage. The formula also ignores enchantments and critical hits, and assumes each attack is performed at maximum charge.\nBedrock Edition[edit | edit source]\nGolden axes attack instantly with no cooldown and deal 4HP damage, but they lower the durability of armor and shields faster than a sword would do.\nRepairing[edit | edit source]\nCombining[edit | edit source]\nIngredients Crafting recipe\n[hide]\nDescription\nDamaged Golden Axe\n\n\nThe durability of the two axes is added together, plus an extra 3 points of durability.\nIngredients Grinding recipe\n[hide]\nDescription\n2× Damaged Golden Axe\nThe durability of the two axes is added together, plus an extra 3 points of durability.\nUnit repair[edit | edit source]\nMain article: Anvil mechanics § Unit repair\nIngredients\n[hide]\nAnvil recipe\nDamaged Golden Axe +\nGold Ingot\nGolden Axe\nA golden axe can be repaired in an anvil by adding golden ingots, with each ingot restoring 25% of the axe's maximum durability, rounded down.

Breaking one of these blocks takes 1 durability.\nBreaking any other block takes 0 durability if the block breaks instantly when broken by hand, or 1 otherwise.\nTilling[edit | edit source]\nHoes are used to turn dirt, grass blocks, and dirt paths into farmland. To till, press use on a grass or dirt block while holding a hoe. This does not work on mycelium or podzol,[1] nor does it work if there are other blocks on top of the targeted blocks, including snow layers or torches. However, mycelium and podzol can be first converted to dirt paths with a shovel, then tilled into farmland with a hoe.\nHoes can be used to convert coarse dirt into regular dirt by pressing use on the coarse dirt. Similar to tilling dirt, the space above the coarse dirt must be empty for it to be tilled.\nHoes can also be used on rooted dirt, which turns it into normal dirt, and yields a hanging roots item.\nTilling is effectively instantaneous, regardless of material, and uses 1 durability. Breaking blocks with a hoe uses 0 or 1 durability, depending on the block.\nHoes are unable to work on blocks with a plant on top, even if that plant could normally be placed on top of farmland without reverting it to dirt.[2]\nWeapon[edit | edit source]\nHoes may be used as a weapon, although they deal only 1HP damage in Java Edition. In Bedrock Edition, hoes can do as much as a pickaxe in terms of damage. Hoes use 1 durability when used as a weapon.\nIn Java Edition, golden hoes have an attack speed modifier -3 (refill in 1s).\nHoes always attack instantly in Bedrock Edition.\nRepairing[edit | edit source]\nCombining[edit | edit source]\nIngredients Crafting recipe\n[hide]\nDescription\nDamaged Golden Hoe\n\n\nThe durability of the two hoes is added together, plus an extra 5% durability.\nIngredients Grinding recipe\n[hide]\nDescription\n2x Damaged Golden Hoe\nThe durability of the two hoes is added together, plus an extra 5% durability.\nUnit repair[edit | edit source]\nMain article: Anvil mechanics § Unit repair\nIngredients\n[hide]\nAnvil recipe\nDamaged Golden Hoe +\nGold Ingot\nGolden Hoe\nA hoe can be repaired in an anvil by adding units of the tiers' repair material, with each repair material restoring 25% the hoe's maximum durability, rounded down.

There is a 8.5% chance (9.5% with Looting I, 10.5% with Looting II and 11.5% with Looting III) for the mob to drop the helmet they're wearing upon death, unless they are spawned from an ominous trial spawner. The dropped helmet is usually badly damaged, and may be enchanted with enchantment levels 5-19.\nIn Bedrock Edition, vindicators and pillagers spawned in raids have a 4.16% chance (5.128% on hard difficulty) to drop an iron helmet.

Each defense point reduces any damage dealt to the player that is absorbed by armor by 4%, increasing additively with the number of defense points. Different materials and combinations of armor provide different levels of defense.\nThe following table shows the number of defense points added by helmets.\nMaterial\nLeather 1 ()\nGolden 2 ()\nChainmail\nIron\nTurtle shell\nDiamond 3 ()\nNetherite\nKnockback resistance[edit | edit source]\nA netherite helmet provides 10% knockback resistance.\nDurability[edit | edit source]\nThe following table shows the amount of damage each piece of armor can absorb before being destroyed.\nAny \"hit\" from a damage source that can be blocked by armor removes one point of durability from each piece of armor worn for every 4HP of incoming damage (rounded down, but never below 1). Damage taken that armor doesn't protect (such as falling or drowning) does not damage the armor, even if it is enchanted to protect against that type of damage.

For more information, see Breaking § Speed.\nBreaking any other block takes 0 durability if the block breaks instantly when broken by hand, or 1 otherwise.\nTilling[edit | edit source]\nHoes are used to turn dirt, grass blocks, and dirt paths into farmland. To till, press use on a grass or dirt block while holding a hoe. This does not work on mycelium or podzol,[1] nor does it work if there are other blocks on top of the targeted blocks, including snow layers or torches. However, mycelium and podzol can be first converted to dirt paths with a shovel, then tilled into farmland with a hoe.\nHoes can be used to convert coarse dirt into regular dirt by pressing use on the coarse dirt. Similar to tilling dirt, the space above the coarse dirt must be empty for it to be tilled.\nHoes can also be used on rooted dirt, which turns it into normal dirt, and yields a hanging roots item.\nTilling is effectively instantaneous, regardless of material, and uses 1 durability. Breaking blocks with a hoe uses 0 or 1 durability, depending on the block.\nHoes are unable to work on blocks with a plant on top, even if that plant could normally be placed on top of farmland without reverting it to dirt.[2]\nWeapon[edit | edit source]\nA hoe loses 2 points of durability when used as a weapon. Hoes may be used as a weapon, although they deal only 1HP damage in Java Edition, identical to that of a bare hand. In Bedrock Edition, hoes do equal damage to pickaxes of the same tier.\nJava Edition[edit | edit source]\nHoes have differing attack speeds depending on the material, and all deal 1HP damage.\nMaterial Wooden Gold Stone Iron Diamond Netherite\nAttack damage 1HP 1HP 1HP 1HP 1HP 1HP\nAttack speed 1 1 2 3 4 4\nDamage per second (DPS) 1 1 2 2[note 1] 2[note 1] 2[note 1]\nDurability 59 32 131 250 1561 2031\nLifetime damage inflicted[note 2] 29HP × 14.5 16HP × 8 65HP × 32.5 125HP × 62.5 780HP × 390 1015HP × 507.5\n↑\na b c Effective DPS is limited at 2 due to the 0.5 second invulnerabity timer.\n↑ The formula to find the total lifetime damage is ceil(durability ÷ 2) × damage per hit. The durability is halved then ceiled because hoes take double durability when used as a weapon, and the last 1 durability can also deal damage. The formula also ignores enchantments and critical hits, and assumes each attack is performed at maximum charge.\nBedrock Edition[edit | edit source]\nIn Bedrock Edition, hoes have no attack cooldown, and deal the following damage:\nMaterial Wooden Gold Stone Iron Diamond Netherite\nAttack damage 3HP 3HP 4HP 5HP 6HP 7HP\nDurability 60 33 132 251 1562 2032\nLifetime damage inflicted[note 1] 90HP × 45 48HP × 24 264HP × 132 625HP × 312.5 4686HP × 2343 7112HP × 3556\nRepairing[edit | edit source]\nCombining[edit | edit source]\nIngredients Crafting recipe\n[hide]\nDescription\nMatching Damaged Hoes\n\n\nThe durability of the two hoes is added together, plus an extra 5% of the tool type's total durability.\nIngredients Grinding recipe\n[hide]\nDescription\nMatching Damaged Hoes\nThe durability of the two hoes is added together, plus an extra 5% durability.\nAnvil repair[edit | edit source]\nMain article: Anvil mechanics § Unit repair\nName Ingredients\n[hide]\nAnvil recipe\nWooden Hoe Damaged Wooden Hoe +\nAny Planks\nWooden Hoe\nStone Hoe Damaged Stone Hoe +\nCobblestone or\nBlackstone or\nCobbled Deepslate\nStone Hoe\nIron Hoe Damaged Iron Hoe +\nIron Ingot\nIron Hoe\nGolden Hoe Damaged Golden Hoe +\nGold Ingot\nGolden Hoe\nDiamond Hoe Damaged Diamond Hoe +\nDiamond\nDiamond Hoe\nNetherite Hoe Damaged Netherite Hoe +\nNetherite Ingot\nNetherite Hoe\nA hoe can be repaired in an anvil by adding units of the tiers' repair material, with each repair material restoring 25% the hoe's maximum durability, rounded down. Two hoes of the same tier can also be combined in an anvil. Both methods preserve the hoe's enchantments.\nEnchantments[edit | edit source]\nA hoe can receive the following enchantments:\nName Description Max level Method Weight\nEfficiency Increases the mining speed. V Enchanting Table\nAnvil 10\nFortune[note 2] Increases the amount of drops when mining. III Enchanting Table\nAnvil 2\nSilk Touch[note 2] Causes blocks to drop themselves when mined.

Doing this angers any bees inside, causing them to attack the player, unless there is a campfire or another block on fire within 5 blocks below the nest or hive. Using normal fire would likely cause the nest, bees, and flowers around it to burn.\nA dispenser with glass bottles can be used to collect the honey without angering the bees.

It does not have netherite, chainmail or turtle scute variants.\nArmor stands[edit | edit source]\nHorse armor cannot be placed or displayed on armor stands as it would be on a horse.\nProtection[edit | edit source]\nHorse armor can be equipped to horses either by manually placing it in its respective slot by pressing inventory while riding the horse (), or by using the horse with it.\nThere is a gradual increase in the defense given from a horse wearing the different types of armor. Note that golden horse armor provides more protection than iron horse armor, whereas the opposite is true for player armor. Diamond horse armor is the only horse armor type to provide any armor toughness.\nMaterial Armor Armor toughness\nLeather 3 () 0\nIron 5 () 0\nGold 7 () 0\nDiamond 11 ( × 5.5) 2\nIf a horse dies while equipped with any horse armor, it drops its normal loot, a saddle (if it had one), and the horse armor.\nLeather horse armor protects horses from freezing in powder snow, but it does not negate other powder snow effects (e.g., falling through, inability to jump).\nDurability[edit | edit source]\nUnlike player armor, horse armor does not have durability. This means a single horse armor can be used infinitely unless destroyed.\nEnchanting[edit | edit source]\nUnlike player armor, horse armor cannot be enchanted in Survival mode. However, in Java Edition Creative mode, horse armor can be used with an anvil to enchant with Thorns, Feather Falling, Protection, Fire Protection, Projectile Protection, Blast Protection, Curse of Binding, and Curse of Vanishing. Other enchantments can be applied, but they have no effect.\nDyeing[edit | edit source]\nMain article: Dyeing § Dyeing armor\nLeather horse armor can be dyed by combining it with dye(s) through crafting‌[JE only] or by using it on a cauldron containing dyed water.‌[BE only] Using leather horse armor on a cauldron containing ordinary water removes any dye from it.\nSmelting[edit | edit source]\nName Ingredients\n[hide]\nSmelting recipe\nIron Nugget or\nGold Nugget Iron Horse Armor or\nGolden Horse Armor +\nAny fuel\n\n\n0.1\nPiglins[edit | edit source]\nPiglins are attracted to golden horse armor and run toward any golden horse armor on the ground, inspecting it for 6 to 8 seconds before putting it in their inventory.\nSounds[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition:\n[hide]\nv t e\nSounds\nSound Subtitles Source Description Resource location Translation key Volume Pitch Attenuation\ndistance\nHorse armor equips Friendly Creatures When armor is equipped to a horse entity.horse.armor subtitles.entity.horse.armor 0.5 1.0 16\nBedrock Edition:\n[hide]\nv t e\nSounds\nSound Source Description Resource location Volume Pitch\nFriendly Creatures When armor is equipped to a horse mob.horse.armor 0.6 1.0\n\nData values[edit | edit source]\nID[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition:\nName Identifier Form\n[hide]\nTranslation key\nLeather Horse Armor leather_horse_armor Item\nitem.minecraft.leather_horse_armor\nIron Horse Armor iron_horse_armor Item\nitem.minecraft.iron_horse_armor\nDiamond Horse Armor diamond_horse_armor Item\nitem.minecraft.diamond_horse_armor\nGolden Horse Armor golden_horse_armor Item\nitem.minecraft.golden_horse_armor\nBedrock Edition:\nName Identifier Alias ID Numeric ID Form\n[hide]\nTranslation key\nLeather Horse Armor leather_horse_armor horsearmorleather 530 Item\nitem.horsearmorleather.name\nIron Horse Armor iron_horse_armor horsearmoriron 531 Item\nitem.horsearmoriron.name\nDiamond Horse Armor diamond_horse_armor horsearmordiamond 533 Item\nitem.horsearmordiamond.name\nGolden Horse Armor golden_horse_armor horsearmorgold 532 Item\nitem.horsearmorgold.name\nItem data[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition:\nSee also: Data component format\n[NBT Compound / JSON Object] components: the item's components tag.\n[NBT Compound / JSON Object]‌[until JE 1.21.5][NBT List / JSON Array][upcoming JE 1.21.5][Int] minecraft:dyed_color: Can be defined as a compound‌[until JE 1.21.5] or an integer.

They are affected by gravity.\nSimilar to ender pearls, there is a short cooldown before the player can throw another ice bomb. The cooldown is shown in the hotbar by a white overlay that shrinks before the player is able to use it again.\nIce bombs explode upon hitting most blocks, including non-solid blocks, but not air. They also explode upon hitting other entities, but they do not take any damage, and unlike eggs and snowballs, the impact is not considered an attack and does no damage or knockback. When exploding, any water (including flowing water, but not waterlogged blocks) in a 3×3×3 cube around the ice bomb freezes into ice. Ice bombs can be used to contain and displace mobs in ice under water.\nWhile endermen teleport away from arrows shot at them, they can be hit by ice bombs.\nThrowing an ice bomb while underwater encloses the player in ice.\nIn Minecraft Education, breezes are able to deflect ice bombs.\nIce bomb arrangement table\nx\ny\n-2 -1 0 1 2\n64 Air Air Air Air Air\n63 Air Air Ice bomb Air Air\n62 Water Ice Ice Ice Water\n61 Water Ice Ice Ice Water\n60 Water Water Water Water Water\nDispensers[edit | edit source]\nIce bombs can be shot from dispensers.\nSounds[edit | edit source]\n[hide]\nSounds\nSound Source Description Resource location Volume Pitch\nHostile Creatures When an ice bomb is created by a lab table mob.wither.break_block 0.5 1.1/1.3\nBlocks When an ice bomb impacts something random.glass 1.0 1.4/1.6\nData values[edit | edit source]\nID[edit | edit source]\nName Identifier Numeric ID Form\n[hide]\nTranslation key\nIce Bomb ice_bomb 595 Item\nitem.ice_bomb.name\nIce Bomb Identifier Numeric ID\n[hide]\nTranslation key\nEntity ice_bomb 106\nentity.ice_bomb.name\nHistory[edit | edit source]\n[hide]\nBedrock Edition\n1.4.0 beta 1.2.20.1 Added ice bombs.\n1.21.0 Preview 1.21.0.21 Ice bombs now appear in the Creative inventory when the Education edition toggle is on.\n[hide]\nMinecraft Education\n1.0.27 Added ice bombs.\n1.21.03 Preview 1.21.01.0 Ice bombs now appear in the Creative inventory.\nIssues[edit | edit source]\nIssues relating to \"Ice Bomb\" are maintained on the bug tracker.

It is usually heavily damaged and is sometimes enchanted.\nRaids[edit | edit source]\nIn Bedrock Edition, Vindicator and pillagers that spawn in raids have a 4.1% chance (5.12% on hard) to drop a badly-damaged iron axe, which is sometimes enchanted with a random enchantment. A vindicator can drop 2 iron axes, one from natural equipment and one from raid drops.\nTrading[edit | edit source]\nVillager Probability Villager wants Player receives\nJE BE\nJourneyman Toolsmith 40% 25% 6–20 × Emerald Enchanted Iron Axe[t 1]\nNovice Weaponsmith 67% 100% 3 × Emerald Iron Axe\n↑ When creating an enchantment offer, the game uses a random enchantment level from 5 – 19.

Breaking a block costs 1 durability.[note 1]\n↑ Blocks that break instantly don't use up durability.\nStripping[edit | edit source]\nUsing an iron axe on a log, wood block, or block of bamboo turns it into a stripped log, stripped wood, or block of stripped bamboo, respectively. This costs 1 point of durability of the axe.\nCopper blocks[edit | edit source]\nUsing an iron axe on a waxed or oxidized copper block removes the wax if it has any, or otherwise remove a level of oxidization. This costs 1 point of durability.\nWeapon[edit | edit source]\nWhen used as a weapon, an iron axe loses 2 durability points.\nJava Edition[edit | edit source]\nAttacking a shield user with an axe disables the use of the shield for 5 seconds. Vindicators, piglin brutes, or other mobs with commands always disable the player's shield. Damage done when using an axe as a weapon is more than that of a sword of the same tier, though they take longer than a sword to recover, resulting in lower DPS.\nAttack Damage Attack Speed Recovery time DPS Lifetime damage inflicted[note 1]\n9HP 0.9 1.11 seconds (22.2 game ticks) 8.1 1125HP × 562.5\n↑ The formula to find the total lifetime damage is ceil(durability ÷ 2) × damage per hit. The durability is halved then ceiled because axes take double durability when used as a weapon, and the last 1 durability can also deal damage. The formula also ignores enchantments and critical hits, and assumes each attack is performed at maximum charge.\nBedrock Edition[edit | edit source]\nIron axes attack instantly with no cooldown and deal 5HP damage, but they lower the durability of armor and shields faster than a sword would do.\nRepairing[edit | edit source]\nCombining[edit | edit source]\nIngredients Crafting recipe\n[hide]\nDescription\nDamaged Iron Axe\n\n\nThe durability of the two axes is added together, plus an extra 3 points of durability.\nIngredients Grinding recipe\n[hide]\nDescription\n2× Damaged Iron Axe\nThe durability of the two axes is added together, plus an extra 3 points of durability.\nUnit repair[edit | edit source]\nMain article: Anvil mechanics § Unit repair\nIngredients\n[hide]\nAnvil recipe\nDamaged Iron Axe +\nIron Ingot\nIron Axe\nAn iron axe can be repaired in an anvil by adding iron ingot, with each ingot restoring 25% of the axe's maximum durability, rounded down. Two iron axes can also be combined in an anvil.

Breaking one of these blocks takes 1 durability.\nBreaking any other block takes 0 durability if the block breaks instantly when broken by hand, or 1 otherwise.\nTilling[edit | edit source]\nHoes are used to turn dirt, grass blocks, and dirt paths into farmland. To till, press use on a grass or dirt block while holding a hoe. This does not work on mycelium or podzol,[1] nor does it work if there are other blocks on top of the targeted blocks, including snow layers or torches. However, mycelium and podzol can be first converted to dirt paths with a shovel, then tilled into farmland with a hoe.\nHoes can be used to convert coarse dirt into regular dirt by pressing use on the coarse dirt. Similar to tilling dirt, the space above the coarse dirt must be empty for it to be tilled.\nHoes can also be used on rooted dirt, which turns it into normal dirt, and yields a hanging roots item.\nTilling is effectively instantaneous, regardless of material, and uses 1 durability. Breaking blocks with a hoe uses 0 or 1 durability, depending on the block.\nHoes are unable to work on blocks with a plant on top, even if that plant could normally be placed on top of farmland without reverting it to dirt.[2]\nWeapon[edit | edit source]\nHoes may be used as a weapon, although they deal only 1HP damage in Java Edition. In Bedrock Edition, hoes can do as much as a pickaxe in terms of damage. Hoes use 1 durability when used as a weapon.\nIn Java Edition, iron hoes have an attack speed modifier -1 (refill in 0.33s).\nHoes always attack instantly in Bedrock Edition.\nRepairing[edit | edit source]\nCombining[edit | edit source]\nIngredients Crafting recipe\n[hide]\nDescription\nDamaged Iron Hoe\n\n\nThe durability of the two hoes is added together, plus an extra 5% durability.\nIngredients Grinding recipe\n[hide]\nDescription\n2x Damaged Iron hoe\nThe durability of the two hoes is added together, plus an extra 5% durability.\nUnit repair[edit | edit source]\nMain article: Anvil mechanics § Unit repair\nIngredients\n[hide]\nAnvil recipe\nDamaged Iron Hoe +\nIron Ingot\nIron Hoe\nA hoe can be repaired in an anvil by adding iron ingots, with each ingot restoring 25% the hoe's maximum durability, rounded down.

Other enchantments can be applied, but they have no effect.\nSmelting[edit | edit source]\nName Ingredients\n[hide]\nSmelting recipe\nIron Nugget Iron Horse Armor +\nAny fuel\n\n\n0.1\nSounds[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition:\n[hide]\nv t e\nSounds\nSound Subtitles Source Description Resource location Translation key Volume Pitch Attenuation\ndistance\nHorse armor equips Friendly Creatures When armor is equipped to a horse entity.horse.armor subtitles.entity.horse.armor 0.5 1.0 16\nBedrock Edition:\n[hide]\nv t e\nSounds\nSound Source Description Resource location Volume Pitch\nFriendly Creatures When armor is equipped to a horse mob.horse.armor 0.6 1.0\n\nData values[edit | edit source]\nID[edit | edit source]\nJava Edition:\nName Identifier Form\n[hide]\nTranslation key\nIron Horse Armor iron_horse_armor Item\nitem.minecraft.iron_horse_armor\nBedrock Edition:\nName Identifier Alias ID Numeric ID Form\n[hide]\nTranslation key\nIron Horse Armor iron_horse_armor horsearmoriron 531 Item\nitem.horsearmoriron.name\nHistory[edit | edit source]\n[hide]\nJava Edition\n1.6.1 13w16a Added iron horse armor.\nHorse armor can be crafted using the following recipe.\n[show]\nRecipe\n\n13w18a The crafting recipe for iron horse armor has been removed.\nIron horse armor can now be found in chests in jungle & desert pyramids, dungeons, nether fortresses, stronghold altar rooms and village blacksmith buildings.\nIron horse armor can now additionally be found in mineshaft chests.\n1.9 15w31a Iron horse armor has been added to end city chests.\n15w43a The average yield of iron horse armor in nether fortress chests has slightly decreased.\n15w44a The average yield of iron horse armor in desert pyramid chests has increased.\nThe average yield of iron horse armor from dungeon chests has slightly decreased.\nIron horse armor has been removed from mineshaft chests.\n1.11.1 16w50a Iron horse armor can now be smelted down into one iron nugget\n1.13 17w45a The texture of iron horse armor have been changed, as the model of horses has changed.\n17w46a The model of iron horse armor has been changed, but the texture of horse armor item has remained unaltered.\n17w47a Prior to The Flattening, the item's numeral ID was 417.\n18w03a The textures of iron horse armor have been changed, as the model of horses has changed.\n18w22a The texture of iron horse armor when equipped has been changed.[1]\n1.14 18w50a The texture of iron horse armor item have been changed.\n19w08a The textures of iron horse armor has been changed.\n1.14.1 Pre-Release 1 The texture of iron horse armor item has been changed.\n1.20.5\nExperiment\nUpdate 1.21 24w05a Iron horse armor can now be obtained as loot in trial chambers.\n1.20.5\nExperiment\nUpdate 1.21 24w11a Iron horse armor can no longer be obtained as loot in trial chambers.\n[hide]\nPocket Edition Alpha\nv0.15.0 build 1 Added iron horse armor.\n[hide]\nPocket Edition\n1.0.0 alpha 0.17.0.1 Horse armor can now be found inside end city chests.\n1.1.0 alpha 1.1.0.0 Iron horse armor is now smeltable.\n[hide]\nBedrock Edition\n1.2.6 beta 1.2.6.2 The texture of iron horse armor have been changed, as the model of horses has been changed.\n1.10.0 beta 1.10.0.3 Iron horse armor can now be found in plains village weaponsmith chests.\nThe textures of all horse armor have been changed.\n1.11.0 beta 1.11.0.1 Horse armor can now be found in savanna, desert, taiga, snowy taiga and snowy tundra village weaponsmith chests.\nbeta 1.11.0.5 The texture of horse armor item have been changed.\n1.20.60\nExperiment\nUpdate 1.21 Preview 1.20.60.20 Iron horse armor can now be obtained as loot in trial chambers.\n1.20.80\nExperiment\nUpdate 1.21 Preview 1.20.80.22 Iron horse armor can no longer be obtained as loot in trial chambers.\n[hide]\nLegacy Console Edition\nXbox 360 Xbox One PS3 PS4 PS Vita Wii U Switch\nTU19 CU7 1.12 1.12 1.12 Patch 1 1.0.1 Added iron horse armor.\nTU53 CU43 1.49 1.50 1.49 Patch 23 1.0.3 Iron horse armor is now smeltable.\n1.90 The texture of iron horse armor has been changed.\n[hide]\nNew Nintendo 3DS Edition\n0.1.0 Added iron horse armor.\nIssues[edit | edit source]\nIssues relating to \"Iron Horse Armor\" are maintained on the bug tracker.
