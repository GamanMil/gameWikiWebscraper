Some of the many animals from Minecraft.
The term Animal refers to a category of mobs that are mainly based on real life animals. Mobs mentioned on this page are classified as Animal or WaterAnimal in the game code. Many other mobs and even some blocks are also based on real life animals, but are not treated as such in Minecraft. Most of these mobs are also called animals in many advancements. The blocks are not listed on this page.
Animals are usually either passive (fleeing) or neutral (fighting), with the only exception being the hostile hoglin.

Classification[edit | edit source]
They take extra damage from tridents enchanted with Impaling,‌[until JE Edition Combat Tests] and, except axolotl, do not cause pufferfish to inflate nor take damage from them. All aquatic mobs except dolphins are immune to drowning, and all except guardians, elder guardians, and turtles take suffocation damage if out of water for too long. Aquatic mobs have the ability to swim, whereas other mobs simply float on water or sink. Axolotls attack all aquatic mobs except turtles, dolphins, frogs, and other axolotls.
All of these mobs are also part of the aquatic entity tag.
Although drowned are an underwater variant of zombies (and can swim in Bedrock Edition), they are classified as undead, not as aquatic.
In Bedrock Edition, there is no in-game classification for these mobs.‌[until BE 1.21.70]

Arthropods take extra damage and receive Slowness IV when hit with a weapon enchanted with Bane of Arthropods. All arthropods except bees have a unique death animation; they flip 180 degrees instead of the usual 90 degrees for other mobs. In Bedrock Edition, cave spiders flip 90 degrees.[1]

Every illager in Java Edition.
Illagers[1] are a type of hostile mob that regularly spawns in woodland mansions, patrols, raids, and pillager outposts.
Illagers are hostile toward players, villagers (excluding baby villagers), wandering traders, snow golems,‌[BE only] and iron golems. Illagers come in three (or four‌[JE only]) classes: pillager, vindicator, evoker, and illusioner.‌[JE only] In Java Edition, all of these mobs are also part of the illager entity tag.

‌[JE only] Pillager Vindicator
Related mobs[edit | edit source]
Ravager Vex Witch
Ravager jockeys[edit | edit source]
A ravager jockey is an illager that spawns riding a ravager. The riders can be pillagers, vindicators, or evokers.
They naturally spawn only in certain waves during raids.
Java Edition
A ravager ridden by a pillager spawns in wave 5. Ravagers ridden by vindicators and evokers spawn in wave 7.
Bedrock Edition
A ravager ridden by a pillager spawns in waves 5 and 7. Ravagers ridden by evokers also spawn in wave 7. Ravagers ridden by vindicators do not spawn during raids, and can be spawned only with commands.
Occurrences[edit | edit source]
Illagers spawn naturally in patrols and raids. They will also spawn in their respective structures:
Pillagers spawn in pillager outposts.
Vindicators and evokers spawn in woodland mansions when they are generated.
Vindicators and evokers that spawn naturally in woodland mansions do not despawn. They also do not respawn when killed.
Ravagers spawn exclusively in raids.
Illusioners‌[JE only] do not spawn naturally and can be summoned only through commands.
Raid captains[edit | edit source]
Main article: Raid captain
Illagers sometimes have their own captain. Any illager has a small chance to be a raid captain with an ominous banner (even when using a spawn egg‌[JE only], or when summoned by commands). Raid captains can spawn in raids‌[JE only] and one pillager raid captain always spawns in patrols.
In Java Edition, the ominous banner equips on the illager's helmet slot. In Bedrock Edition, the illager banner equips on the illager's chestplate slot.
Event[edit | edit source]
Main articles: Patrol and Raid
Illagers have their own in-game events, led by raid captains‌[JE only]:
Patrol — a naturally spawned group of five pillagers roaming the landscape and monitoring the villages.
Raid — waves of illagers and witches spawn and attack a village with ominous horn blares. In Java Edition, An illager captain spawns in each wave with other illagers, usually with a vindicator as the captain. It is triggered when a player with the Bad Omen status effect enters a village. Raiders and villagers usually have different behavior in a raid. In Bedrock Edition, any killed raiders drops special loot. Both raiders and villagers celebrate after defeating or saving a village respectively.
Effects[edit | edit source]
Main articles: Bad Omen, Raid Omen and Hero of the Village
Killing a raid captain drops a ominous bottle, which when drank, gives the Bad Omen effect that, when that player enters a village, it becomes Raid Omen. The raid starts where the player got raid omen. The level of the effect increases the enchantment power of pillagers' and vindicators' crossbows and axes, respectively, and omens with a level higher than 1 cause an extra wave of raiders to occur ‌[JE only]. When all waves have been finished in a raid, the Hero of the Village effect is given, which decreases prices when trading with villagers. The level of the effect scales with the level of the omen that triggered the raid.
Rune[edit | edit source]
Main article: MCD:Illageralt
The illageralt alphabet.
Illagers have an alphabet called illageralt, a rune font from Minecraft Dungeons. This font is currently usable only in Java Edition via commands.
Java Edition[edit | edit source]
All illagers ignore baby villagers, but may still hit them by accident.
Illagers do not retaliate when hit by a missed arrow shot by a pillager or illusioner.
A vindicator can disable the player's shield with its iron axe attack, even when riding a mob. If a player fails to land a melee attack on a vindicator that rides a ravager during a raid in Hard difficulty, the vindicator rider can deal great damage to a player without protection from a shield.
All illagers, ravagers, and witches within 48 blocks of a bell that has been rung gain three seconds of the Glowing effect, effectively highlighting them through walls.
Reinforcements[edit | edit source]
On all difficulty levels, damaged illager mobs call all other illagers of their respective type within an area centered on the attacked illager to target the attacker, as long as the attacker is a non-illager. For example, pillagers attack a skeleton that injures another pillager, but pillagers do not aid a vindicator hit by a skeleton.[more information needed]
Raids[edit | edit source]
During raids, vindicators can open doors like villagers. They can break wooden doors in Normal or Hard difficulty, if they cannot open the door successfully.[2] Evokers and illusioners gain high movement speed without any effect.
A raid captain spawns in each wave with other raiders, usually with a vindicator as the captain.
Illagers pick up ominous banners dropped by raid captains, depends on how many raid captains die in this wave. If the raid captain is still alive, they do not pick up the banner from last wave remains or if thrown by the player.
Patrols[edit | edit source]
All illagers, ravagers, and witches join nearby patrol actively. If a ""Johnny"" vindicator joins a patrol, all patrol members assume the ""Johnny"" vindicator's aggressive behavior.
Bedrock Edition[edit | edit source]
All illagers and vexes ignore baby villagers, but pillagers may still shoot them by accident.
A dispenser can equip an evoker, vindicator, or pillager with armor. However, no armor is visible on them and no armor drops upon death.
Pillagers and ravagers do not purposefully attack other illagers. However, non-pillagers and non-ravagers do attack pillagers who hit them with missed arrows.[3] Vindicators and evokers retaliate against a pillager if the pillager accidentally hits the vindicator or evoker with an arrow, although the evoker fang deals no damage to pillagers. Vexes summoned by an injured evoker can still attack the pillager.
A ""ravager with vindicator rider"" is unused in Bedrock Edition. It can be summoned by a spawn event command without raid configuration.
After the Texture Update, illagers still use the Java Edition 1.14 snapshot texture, including some of the Marketplace textures (for example, the pillager's arms).[4] Also, a ravager's leg texture in Bedrock Edition is different from that in Java edition.

Issues relating to ""Illager"" are maintained on the bug tracker. Issues should be reported and viewed there.
Trivia[edit | edit source]
During the development of Minecraft Dungeons, Mojang decided that the game needed a significantly larger number of hostile mobs than existed at the time. This lead to the creation of a generically evil faction in the illagers that could be used in any sort of spin-off media.[5]
Jeb stated that illagers could have any agenda or skills necessary to fuel a story's plot. However, these skills should lean more toward being magic-oriented than technical.[5]
According to Minecraft: Mobestiary, illagers were ""expelled"" from villages due to their ""unspeakable activities.""
Witches ally with the illagers during raids. Cory Scheviak jokingly explained that witches spawned in raids are just along for the ride.[6]
According to Jeb, illagers were originally called ""ill-willed villagers"" or ""illvillagers"", but ""evillagers"" and ""illagers"" were also suggested. The lattermost option was chosen as it was the shortest.[5]
Following that, ""illager"" is ""fybo"" (bad villager) in Swedish, from ""bybo"" (villager), since it creates the same pun and meaning as the English term.[5]

↑ ""The Illagers were created because we were talking about having some kind of generic, evil soldier mob in the game—slightly more intelligent than skeletons. It felt natural to have an evil villager. We figured they were ill-willed villagers and so from the beginning they were supposed to be ""Ill Villagers"". And then Tommaso suggested they should be EVIL-agers—and then we cut it down to just Illagers.""-Jens Bergensten-""Meet the Vindicator"" – minecraft.net, June 20, 2017.

Trivia[edit | edit source]
The warden is the only monster that does not count towards the Monster Hunter advancement or Monsters Hunted challenge.
The reason for this is because the warden is not intended to be slain, and is instead meant to be evaded.

A giant in a cave.
Despite the giant being an oversized variant of the zombie, it's not considered an undead mob.
Despite the ghast's ghost-like appearance, it is not considered an undead mob.[2]
The warden was classified as an undead mob in experimental snapshots. This property did not carry over to its official addition in snapshot 22w12a.
In Java Edition, all the undead mobs except for the horses are classified as monsters in the code, however, in Bedrock Edition, they are part of the monster category as well.
Although undead mobs share the #undead entity tag, the tag is not responsible for their shared properties.
