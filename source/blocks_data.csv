Obtaining[edit | edit source]
Breaking[edit | edit source]
An activator rail can be broken by hand or using any tool, dropping itself as an item, but a pickaxe is the fastest. To break an activator rail, mine it:

Usage[edit | edit source]
An activator rail can be used as a rail and as a redstone component.
To place an activator rail, use an activator rail item while pointing at a surface facing the space the activator rail should occupy. An activator rail can be placed on:
the top of any full solid opaque block (stone, dirt, blocks of gold, etc.), including full-block mechanism components (command blocks, dispensers, droppers, note blocks, and redstone lamps)
the top of a hopper, upside-down slab, or upside-down stairs.
the top of any transparent block (glass, etc.)
An activator rail cannot be attached to the side or bottom of any block, but attempting to make such an attachment may cause the activator rail to attach to the top of a block under the destination space. For example, if a fence is on the ground, attempting to attach an activator rail to the side of the fence causes the activator rail to be attached to the top of the ground next to the fence instead.
When placed, an activator rail configures itself to line up with any adjacent rails (including detector rails, powered rails, and other activator rails), as well as adjacent rails one block up. The behaviors in Java and Bedrock editions diverge in the following ways.
In Java Edition:
If there are two adjacent rails on non-opposite sides, or three or more adjacent rails, or no adjacent rails at all, an activator rail aligns itself in the direction the player is facing. If an existing activator rail is connected to only one other rail or none at all, and a new rail is placed perpendicular to the activator rail, then the activator rail aligns itself in the east-west direction (if it isn't already facing that way). If a rail it would align with is one block up, an activator rail slants upward toward it (with multiple options to slant upward to, an activator rail ""prefers"" west or south). Other configurations can be created by placing and removing various rails.[needs testing]
In Bedrock Edition:
If there are two adjacent rails on non-opposite sides, or three or more adjacent rails, an activator rail aligns itself in the east-west direction. If there are no adjacent rails, an activator rail aligns itself in the north-south direction (but if a rail is later placed to the east or west, the activator rail re-orients itself in the east-west direction even if it is already connected to another rail to the north or south). If a rail it would align with is one block up, an activator rail slants upward toward it (with multiple options to slant upward to, an activator rail ""prefers"", in order: west, east, south, and north). Other configurations can be created by placing and removing various rails.
It cannot be placed suspended in midair, even with commands.[1]
Rail[edit | edit source]
Main article: Rail
Activator rails (and other rails) can be used as ""roads"" for minecarts. A minecart that enters an activator rail's space from either end of the activator rail continues to move, losing only a little velocity (which can then be increased again with powered rails). A minecart that enters an activator rail's space from the side turns east or south (depending on the activator rail's orientation), or in the downward direction for a slanted activator rail.
Redstone component[edit | edit source]
See also: Redstone circuit
Activator rails can be used to affect minecarts that travel over them.
Activation
An activator rail is a redstone mechanism and can be activated by:
an adjacent active power component (for example, a redstone torch, a block of redstone, a daylight sensor, etc.)
an adjacent powered block (strongly-powered or weakly-powered)
a powered redstone comparator or redstone repeater facing the activator rail
powered redstone dust configured to point at the activator rail, or configured as a plus sign. An activator rail is not activated by adjacent powered redstone dust that is configured to point in another direction.
An activated activator rail also activates any adjacent activator rails it is connected to, up to eight away from the original activation source. Thus a single activation source can activate up to 17 rails (one original in the middle and eight on either side). An activated activator rail does not activate adjacent rails not connected to it.
Activation and deactivation are instant and occur in the same gametick the power source turns on or off (any eventual delay depends on the power source).
Behavior
An activator rail affects minecarts above it with varying effects that occur as soon as any part of the minecart is on the activator rail.
An active activator rail:
starts shaking, and ejects mobs (including players) from minecarts — the destination location is picked the same way as when dismounting a minecart
repeatedly activates minecarts with command blocks — a command block minecart executes its command every four game ticks until the command block minecart is no longer on the activator rail
disables minecarts with hoppers — a disabled hopper minecart cannot pick up items it travels through until it is enabled by an inactive activator rail (or until it is broken and re-placed)
primes minecarts with TNT — primed TNT minecarts explode after four seconds with an explosive power proportional to their speed over the activator rail.
An inactive activator rail enables minecarts with hoppers — an enabled hopper minecart picks up items it travels through until it is disabled by an active activator rail.
A hopper minecart stops picking up items in the same tick it touches an active activator rail or in the same tick the inactive rail it is standing on is powered (it does not collect the item it could have taken from a container above in the same tick the activator rail turns on and takes the first item in the same tick the rail turns off again).
Mob interaction[edit | edit source]
Like other types of rails, spiders, cave spiders, and wardens are the only land mobs that can walk onto activator rails.‌[Java Edition only]

Air is an invisible block used to define empty space where other blocks could otherwise exist; it represents the negative or absence of a block. It is one of the few blocks in the game that players cannot normally interact with.
Cave air‌[Java Edition only] is a variant found only underground in carver caves and some generated structures along with features like lava lakes.
Void air‌[Java Edition only] is a variant used internally for the 'air' in unloaded chunks and outside of the world height limits (above Y=319 and below Y=-64 in the Overworld, and above Y=255 and below Y=0 in the Nether and the End dimensions).

Appearance[edit | edit source]
All types of air are completely invisible and unable to be viewed or interacted with directly.
The only exception is that air can be visualized with the use of structure blocks in Save mode: when ""Show invisible blocks"" is enabled, air is represented as small blue cubes. Air, cave air, and void air are all displayed identically in this manner.
Obtaining[edit | edit source]
In Bedrock Edition, air cannot be obtained in the inventory without editing. In Java Edition, the block is completely unobtainable. It cannot be obtained with the /give command. Air can be destroyed or created only by the placement or removal of other blocks respectively.
Distribution[edit | edit source]
Upon world generation, all otherwise empty spaces are occupied by air.
In Java Edition, carver caves and some underground structures generate containing cave air instead, including mineshafts[1], strongholds, monster rooms, and lava lakes[2], and void air is used in place of unloaded chunks and above or below the world's buildable area to denote illegal locations for blocks to be put.
Usage[edit | edit source]
Air, shown at left, is represented by blue cubes within structures. Cave air and void air are also shown as such.
Air shares some properties with non-solid blocks, including allowing the player or mob to move within that space without suffocating, and also to catch their breath if they are drowning in water.
Cave air and void air have no special properties; they function the same as normal air.

Breaking[edit | edit source]
An allium can be broken instantly with any item or by hand, dropping itself.
An allium also breaks if water or lava runs over its location, if a piston extends or pushes a block into its location, or if a block under the plant is moved or destroyed.

Natural generation[edit | edit source]
Alliums generate naturally on dirt and grass blocks in flower forest and meadow biomes as part of gradients.
Potted alliums can also be found in woodland mansions.
Post-generation[edit | edit source]
Main article: Flower § Post-generation
When bone meal is applied to a grass block in a flower forest, and a meadow in Java Edition, alliums have a chance of generating on the targeted block and adjacent grass blocks in a 15×5×15 area in Java Edition, or a 7×5×7 area in Bedrock Edition. Whether alliums can generate depends on the flower gradients.
In Bedrock Edition, when bone meal is applied to an allium in any biome, more alliums appear on top of nearby grass blocks. The flowers can appear up to 3 blocks away from the original, forming a 7×7 square.
Mob loot[edit | edit source]
In Java Edition, endermen can pick up alliums, like any other one-block-tall flower, and drop it if killed while holding it.
Generated loot[edit | edit source]
In Bedrock Edition, 8 alliums are found inside the chest in the ""allium room"" in woodland mansions. Due to a bug, this room does not generate in Java Edition.[1]
Trading[edit | edit source]
Wandering traders may sell an allium for a single emerald.
Usage[edit | edit source]
Main article: Flower § Usage
Like other flowers, alliums can be used as decoration and planted on grass blocks, dirt, coarse dirt, rooted dirt, farmland, podzol, mycelium, moss blocks, mud, or muddy mangrove roots.
Alliums can also be placed in flower pots.

Bees[edit | edit source]
Bees engage in a pollinating behavior with alliums, increasing the honey level in beehives and bee nests by 1.
Breeding[edit | edit source]
Alliums can be used to breed, grow, and lead bees.
Bee nests[edit | edit source]
Oak, birch, and cherry trees grown from saplings that are within 2 blocks of an allium have a 5% chance to grow with a bee nest and 2-3 bees in it.
Composting[edit | edit source]
Placing an allium into a composter has a 65% chance of raising the compost level by 1. A stack of alliums yields an average of 5.94 bone meal.

Obtaining[edit | edit source]
Allow and deny blocks can either be obtained by using the pick block control, or by using various commands, such as /give, or the Creative inventory‌[Minecraft Education only].
Usage[edit | edit source]
When placed, allow blocks let players without world builder status place or destroy blocks in the area above them if immutable world is on, while deny blocks prohibit players without world builder, and their agents, from placing or destroying blocks in the area above them. This area covers an infinite distance above the block but does not cover the area below the block. If two allow or deny blocks are placed on top of one another, the block that is highest takes precedence. The deny block does not prevent the placing of blocks through commands, endermen, or pistons. They also do not prevent the placing of entities such as boats.
In Bedrock Edition, when placed, allow blocks let players in Adventure status place or destroy blocks in the area above, while deny blocks prohibit Members in Survival from placing or destroying blocks in the area above them.
Both blocks are extremely resistant to explosions, and players with world builder (or permission level 1‌[Bedrock Edition only]) status are able to place and destroy blocks regardless of where any allow or deny blocks are placed and can also destroy and place the blocks themselves.
Allow blocks do not enable players without building/destroying permissions to build on top of them.

Allow and deny blocks cannot be moved by pistons or sticky pistons.

Breaking[edit | edit source]
The amethyst cluster block drops itself in any of its growth stages (rather than its amethyst shard drops) when mining it with any tool with the Silk Touch enchantment.
When mined without Silk Touch or broken by being pushed off an attached block by a piston or sticky piston, only fully grown amethyst clusters drop amethyst shards, while amethyst buds drop nothing. Breaking an amethyst cluster with a pickaxe drops 4 shards while any other method of breaking it yields 2 shards. The maximum amount of amethyst shards dropped can be increased with Fortune; Fortune I gives a 1⁄3 chance for 8 shards (averaging 5.33 shards), Fortune II gives a 25% chance (each) to give 8 or 12 shards (averaging 7 shards), and Fortune III gives a 20% chance (each) to give 8, 12, or 16 shards (averaging 8.8 shards).

Natural generation[edit | edit source]
Amethyst buds and clusters generate naturally as part of amethyst geodes, on exposed faces of budding amethysts.
Post-generation[edit | edit source]
Every time a budding amethyst block receives a random tick, there is a 20% chance for a small amethyst bud to generate on any of its sides, as long as the block being replaced with the small amethyst bud is air or a water source block.
Usage[edit | edit source]
Growing into amethyst clusters[edit | edit source]
An amethyst bud placed on a budding amethyst (rather than any other block) regardless whether it was placed by the player or spawned by the budding amethyst itself, grows over time, going through three growth stages – small, medium, and large – before reaching its 4th and final growth stage as an amethyst cluster, which drops amethyst shards when mined.
In Java Edition, the below logic can be applied:
Per random tick, updates occur to any given block in the loaded chunk every 68.27 seconds on average if the chunk center is within 128 blocks of a player's location.
Each random tick assigned to the budding amethyst block has a 20% chance of creating a new amethyst bud or incrementing the growth stage on one randomly-selected side of the six-sided block. And if the randomly-selected side is obstructed, then it fails and nothing happens.
There are 4 growth stages.
As such, the math can be applied if a player is within random tick range as:
(68.27 seconds average for random ticks) × (20% chance of growth for any given single side) × (6 sides) × (4 growth stages) = 68.27×5×6×4 = 8192.4 seconds average, also 2 hours 16 minutes 32.4 seconds, also 6.827 in-game days.
Decoration[edit | edit source]
They can also be placed on certain other types of blocks for decoration. The block must be solid and have at least side sides that form a full surface: for example, they can be placed on the bottom of stairs (or top of upside down stairs), but not on their side, or top. They can also be placed on the bottom of bottom slabs and on the top of top slabs. Of blocks that meet these criteria, some are still excluded.
Amethyst clusters cannot be placed on:
All non-solid blocks;
blocks without any full surfaces, like fences, fence gates, walls, glass panes, iron bars, lightning rods, chains, heads, grindstones, bells, lanterns, cauldrons, anvils, conduits, decorated pots, chests, pointed dripstone;
leaves;
big dripleaf;
honey blocks;
chorus flowers.
Light[edit | edit source]
Small, medium, and large amethyst buds give off a light level of 1, 2 and 4 respectively, while amethyst clusters give off a light level of 5.
Sound[edit | edit source]
Uniquely among other blocks an amethyst cluster in all its growth stages makes a quiet overlay sound when generally interacted with as well as its block breaking sound when hit with a projectile.

Obtaining[edit | edit source]
An ant cannot be obtained as an item even by using the /give command. An ant can be placed using commands such as /fill or /setblock, and naturally generates in the ""ant"" dimension. It cannot be mined or exploded.
Natural generation[edit | edit source]
One ant block naturally generates in the ""ant"" dimension, where it begins moving immediately.
Usage[edit | edit source]
An ant simulates Langton's ant. If placed on top of black or white concrete, it moves in a deterministic pattern, turning the concrete underneath it into its other variation. The ant block is the Turing machine mentioned in the update's changelog.
If two ant blocks collide, they merge into one. It cannot be pushed by pistons, and can replace bedrock.

Ancient debris is a rare ore found in the Nether, and is the main source of netherite scraps, which can then be used to craft netherite ingots. Its high blast resistance makes it immune to normal explosions. In item form, it floats on lava and is completely immune to any form of fire.

Natural generation[edit | edit source]
Ancient debris generates in the Nether in the form of scatter ores which are never naturally exposed to air.[note 1] They can only replace netherrack, basalt‌[Java Edition only], and blackstone‌[Java Edition only].
On average, Y-level 16 has the most ancient debris.
Generation of Ancient debris varies by edition.
In Java Edition, up to two clusters may generate per chunk:
One cluster of 0–3 ancient debris attempts to generate with a triangle distribution from levels 8 to 24.
An additional cluster of 0–2 ancient debris attempts to generate evenly from levels 8 to 119.
In Bedrock Edition, up to five clusters may generate per chunk:
Two clusters of 0–3 ancient debris attempt to generate evenly from levels 8 to 23.
An additional three clusters of 0–2 ancient debris attempt to generate evenly from levels 8 to 119.
In Java Edition, There is an average of 1.65 ancient debris blocks per chunk[needs testing], with a normal maximum of 5. [note 2] As of Java Edition 1.16.5, on average they generate 1.56 ores per chunk. Given this number, and that there are 32768 blocks in a chunk (16×128×16), there is approximately a 0.004% chance that any randomly selected block will be an ancient debris block.
Generated loot[edit | edit source]
Ancient debris can appear in bastion chests, either as a singular item or as a stack of two items. These two options are rolled separately from each other.

Redstone component[edit | edit source]
Because of its unique combination of being both blast resistant enough to withstand TNT and being movable with a piston, ancient debris is sometimes used as a redstone component, usually in tunnel bores.

Trivia[edit | edit source]
The texture of the ancient debris is supposed to look like pressed metal plates.[1]
Ancient debris is actually what remains of the mining activity of the piglins, who extracted all the original netherite ore.[2]
It is possible to find blobs of up to 20 contiguous ancient debris - up to five debris can generate in a chunk, so if a blob of five generates in adjacent corners of four different chunks, a blob of 20 debris would be created.

Notes[edit | edit source]
↑ The generation system explicitly attempts to place ancient debris where it is not exposed to air. Rarely, ancient debris can be exposed by later generation processes. It can also be exposed to fungi, or alongside smaller pockets of lava.
↑ However, it is technically possible for up to 11 ancient debris to be found in a single chunk; adjacent chunks can generate blobs on the border with up to 2 blocks spawning in an adjacent chunk.

Natural generation[edit | edit source]
See also: Ore (feature)
Andesite can generate in the Overworld in the form of ore blobs. Andesite attempts to generate in two batches. The first batch generate 2 times per chunk in blobs of size 0-864, from elevations 0 to 60, in all biomes. The second batch has 1⁄6 chance to generate blobs of size 0-864, from elevation 64 to 128. In Bedrock Edition, andesite can replace stone, diorite, granite, polished andesite, polished diorite and polished granite. In Java Edition, andesite can replace stone, diorite, granite, tuff and deepslate.
In Bedrock Edition, andesite generates naturally in coral reefs, replacing some coral as part of coral crusts.

1.17 21w06a The height limit was expanded down to Y=-64. Andesites are temporary generating from Y=-64 instead of Y=0.
21w07a Andesite blobs are now larger and more spherical, but less common.
21w08a Andesite is no longer able to generate below Y=0.
21w15a The changes to andesite generation in the previous 1.17 snapshots have been reverted, but they can be re-enabled with the Caves & Cliffs Prototype Data Pack.

Trivia[edit | edit source]
In the real world, andesite rock comes from above-ground lava flows. Finding andesite underground means the world's surface used to be lower, and the lava flow was buried.
Diorite is andesite's below-ground equivalent: The two rocks come from the same kind of magma, but diorite rocks are formed from solidifying underground magma chambers. The long, slow cool makes it look coarser than andesite.

An anvil is a gravity-affected utility block used to rename items, combine enchantments and repair items without losing the enchantments. An anvil has limited durability, and as it is used or dropped too far, gradually becomes a chipped anvil, then a damaged anvil, then breaks and vanishes.

Natural generation[edit | edit source]
A damaged anvil generates in the ""Forge room"" of the woodland mansion. A damaged anvil can also generate in trail ruins.
Crafting[edit | edit source]
A total of 31 iron ingots (including 27 for three blocks of iron) are required to craft an anvil.

Usage[edit | edit source]
Repairing and renaming items[edit | edit source]
The GUI of the anvil.
Main article: Anvil mechanics
Anvils have two modes to repair items that have a durability rating:
As with the grindstone, a player may repair items by combining two similar items. With the anvil, however, the target retains its enchantments and may gain new ones from the sacrificed items.
Alternatively, a player can use materials originally required in the crafting of the item (iron ingots for iron items with durability, diamonds for diamond items with durability) to repair a single item. One material can repair 25% of the target's maximum durability. This is a good deal in the case of a chestplate, for example; a full repair (four materials) would total only half of the item's original cost (eight materials). In the case of tools and weapons, however, this may be a significantly less economical option; combining two diamond shovels would cost two diamonds in total, while up to four diamonds could be required to directly repair one. Still, it may be worth making the more expensive upgrade if the enchantments are considered difficult to obtain.
If the items are unable to be combined, a red ""X"" appears over the arrow pointing to the slot of the resulting item. Also, if the target item is at full durability and the sacrifice does not have any enchantments, the anvil also refuses to combine the items, unless if renaming the item to a valid name.
In addition, the player can rename any item – not just items with durability – by using an anvil.
Repairing[edit | edit source]
See also: Repair
Example showing a repair of two diamond pickaxes.
Repairing with materials works for the most part, but not with all items: in general, repairing works for items with their material in the default name. For example, an anvil can repair an iron pickaxe with materials (iron in this case) while an anvil cannot repair bows or shears except with other bows or shears. Special cases: chain armor can be repaired with iron ingots, turtle shells can be repaired with turtle scutes, maces can be repaired with breeze rods, and elytra can be repaired with phantom membranes. The repair does not need to be complete; one material repairs 1⁄4 of the item's maximum durability. Repair of an unenchanted item can cost more material than simply crafting a new item or combining damaged items. The exception is armor, which consumes less material at the cost of experience levels.
Repairing with a matching item works for any item with durability including bows, shears and so on. The items must be a matching tool and of a matching material. For example, a golden pickaxe cannot combine with a golden sword or iron pickaxe.
In both cases, the resulting durability is limited to the item's maximum, and there is no discount for ""over-repair"".
As a subset of repairing one item with another, the anvil can transfer enchantments from the sacrifice to the target. This can have a synergistic effect when both items share identical enchantments, or simply add to each other when they do not. Two Sharpness II swords can be combined to make a Sharpness III sword, for example, or a pickaxe with Efficiency can be combined with one that has Unbreaking. This can produce enchantments and combinations that are not possible with an enchanting table. But even so, some enchantments cannot be combined if they are similar, or contradicting, in terms of what they do. If the target is damaged, the player has to pay for the repair as well as the transfer.
Transferring high-level enchantments is more expensive, and renaming an item has an additional surcharge. The anvil has a limit of 39 levels; beyond that, repairs are refused. This limit is not present in Creative mode.
Every time armor or tools are repaired, the minimum experience cost doubles (e.g., 1 level, 2 levels, 4 levels, 8 levels, etc.).
Renaming[edit | edit source]
Any item or stack of items can be renamed at a cost of one level plus any prior-work penalty. If the player is only renaming, the maximum total cost is 39 levels. The maximum length for renaming is 30 characters‌[BE only] or 50 characters‌[JE only]. Some items have special effects when renamed:
A name tag must be renamed before it can be used.
Renaming a bucket of fish, axolotl, or tadpole renames the mob inside as well, meaning a fish, axolotl or tadpole can be named without a name tag.‌[Java Edition only][1]
A renamed item (can be any item, doesn't need to be a weapon) that kills another player or tamed mob causes the name to appear in the death message.‌[Java Edition only]
A renamed spawn egg produces a mob with the same name.
Chests, trapped chests, shulker boxes, furnaces, hoppers, droppers, dispensers, minecarts with chests, minecarts with hoppers, enchantment tables, barrels, smokers, blast furnaces and brewing stands display the name in their GUI when placed.
Renamed command blocks use their name in chat messages instead of [@].
Any name changes to items are applied to the data tag {Item:{tag:{display:{Name:""{\""text\"":\""<name>\""}""}}}}. Similarly, this data tag can be accessed by the nbt argument using target selectors.
If the item name field is left blank, or is only whitespace or non-breaking spaces (or a combination of both), the default name for that item is used instead. Also, if the item name is unchanged from its current name (which can occur when renaming an item for the first time and using any of the aforementioned blank parameters), a red ""X"" appears on top of the arrow in the GUI.
Named items do not stack with unnamed or differently-named items of the same type.
Enchanted books[edit | edit source]
Enchanted books can be used to enchant tools, armor and weapons. Enchanted books themselves can be combined to create higher-tiered books. This makes an anvil an alternative to the enchantment table.
Falling anvils[edit | edit source]
Falling Anvil
Java Edition
Bedrock Edition
Hitbox size
Height: 0.98 Blocks
Width: 0.98 Blocks
Main article: Falling Block
When there is no supporting block below an anvil, the anvil falls in the same way sand, gravel, concrete powder, and dragon eggs fall. A placed anvil cannot be pushed or pulled by pistons,‌[Java Edition only] but a falling anvil can be pushed (though cannot be pulled), as it is an entity. This is different in Bedrock Edition where anvils can be pushed and pulled by pistons. Anvils make a metallic clang sound when they land.
A falling anvil damages any player or mob that it falls on. The damage amount depends on fall distance: 2HP per block fallen after the first (e.g., an anvil that falls 4 blocks deals 6HP damage). The damage is capped at 40HP × 20, no matter how far the anvil falls. Helmets take twice as much durability damage as other armor pieces, but do not provide any special protection other than the normal armor damage reduction.[2] When a player dies by an anvil falling on them, the death message ""<player> was squashed by a falling anvil"" appears. However, if a player is merely touched by a falling anvil entity, no damage is dealt unless the falling anvil becomes an anvil block in the same block where the player is located.
If an anvil falls onto a block with a solid top surface, but the same block it is in cannot be replaced (torch, slab, etc.), it breaks and drops as an item.
An anvil can fall into the void if there is a straight path to it.
When an anvil entity is in perpetual motion using slime blocks, it breaks after about 30 seconds.
Maps[edit | edit source]
Main article: Map
An anvil can be used instead of a crafting table to zoom a map out, to clone a map, or to place a player position marker on a map.‌[Bedrock Edition only]

‌[Bedrock Edition only]
Maps crafted with only paper do not show the location marker; to add it, a compass must be added to the map.
Becoming damaged[edit | edit source]
With each use, an anvil has a 12% chance to become damaged – degrading one stage at a time, first becoming chipped, then damaged, then eventually destroyed. An anvil typically survives for 25 uses on average or approximately one use per 1.24 iron ingots used in crafting the anvil.
An anvil can be damaged and destroyed from falling. If it falls from a height greater than one block, the chance of degrading by one stage is 5% × the number of blocks fallen.
The damage state does not affect the anvil's function, but only anvils of the same damage state can stack in inventory.
When an anvil is destroyed, the player automatically leaves the anvil GUI and it disappears.
Creative mode[edit | edit source]
In creative mode, the anvil functions a little differently than other game modes:
Any repair/enchant/rename operation may be done, regardless of the player's experience level. In Java Edition, incompatible enchantments are allowed as well.
The experience cost is not taken from the player.
The repair cost of tools does still increase.
It continues doubling with each repair, past the usual limit of 39 levels.
When it reaches the capacity of signed 32-bit integers, no repair cost is shown and the ""product"" item cannot be taken out of the anvil. Tools in this state also cannot be renamed or enchanted.
Anvils are not damaged on use.

Falling block entity[edit | edit source]
Main article: Falling Block
[NBT Compound / JSON Object] Dynamic block entity data
Tags common to all entities[show]
[NBT Compound / JSON Object] BlockState: The falling block represented by this entity.
[String] Name: The resource location of the block.
[NBT Compound / JSON Object] Properties: Optional. The block states of the block.
[String] Name: The block state name and its value.
[Byte] CancelDrop: 1 or 0 (true/false) - true if the block should be destroyed instead of placed after landing on a solid block. When true, the block is not dropped as an item, even if the DropItem tag is set to true. However, if the entity is deleted due to its Time value being too high, this tag is ignored and an item is dropped depending on the DropItem tag. CancelDrop defaults to 1 for falling suspicious sand and suspicious gravel, and 0 for the other vanilla falling blocks and any summoned falling block.
[Byte] DropItem: 1 or 0 (true/false) – true if the block should drop as an item when it breaks. Any block that does not have an item form with the same ID as the block does not drop even if this is set.
[Float] FallHurtAmount: Multiplied by the FallDistance to calculate the amount of damage to inflict. By default this value is 2HP for anvils, and 6HP for pointed dripstone.
[Int] FallHurtMax: The maximum hit points of damage to inflict on entities that intersect this falling block. For vanilla falling blocks, always 40HP × 20.
[Byte] HurtEntities: 1 or 0 (true/false) – true if the block should hurt entities it falls on. Defaults to 1 for anvils and pointed dripstone and to 0 for the other vanilla falling blocks and any summoned falling block.
[NBT Compound / JSON Object] TileEntityData: Optional. The tags of the block entity for this block.
[Int] Time: The number of ticks the entity has existed. When Time goes above 600, or above 100 while the block is at Y=-64 or is outside building height, the entity is deleted.

Trivia[edit | edit source]
If placed on top of exploding TNT blocks, the explosion does not affect the surrounding area. This is because the anvil falls into the space the TNT entity is occupying, and since the TNT's explosion power is not high enough to destroy the anvil, no blocks are destroyed.
Before they were added to Minecraft, anvils were already present in Minicraft.

Breaking[edit | edit source]
Azaleas can be broken instantly using any tool or by hand. Harvesting an azalea with shears consumes the durability of the shears for no additional benefit.
An azalea also breaks if a piston extends or pushes a block into its location, or if water flows into it.

Axes are considered the preferred tool,[1] and swords would also increase the breaking speed,[2] however these ultimately have no impact due to the instant default mining speed.
Natural generation[edit | edit source]
Azaleas generate commonly on top of moss blocks in lush caves.
Post-generation[edit | edit source]
When decayed or mined with any tool except shears and tools enchanted with Silk Touch, azalea leaves have a 5% chance to drop azaleas. The Fortune enchantment increases the rate to 6.25% at level I, 8.33% at level II and 10% at level III.
When using bone meal on a moss block, each block in a 3×3 to 7×7 area has a 15% chance of growing an azalea.
Usage[edit | edit source]
Azaleas can be placed on grass blocks, dirt, coarse dirt, rooted dirt, podzol, moss blocks, farmland, mud, muddy mangrove roots and clay.
Unlike most transparent blocks, mobs can spawn on top of azaleas in Java Edition[3].
Composting[edit | edit source]
Putting an azalea in a composter has a 65% chance of increasing the composting level.
Fuel[edit | edit source]
Azaleas can be used as a fuel source in furnaces, smelting 0.5 items per azalea.
Growing trees[edit | edit source]
Unlike saplings, an azalea does not automatically grow into an azalea tree. Therefore, using bone meal on it is the only way to grow an azalea tree. Application of bone meal gives an azalea a 45% chance to grow into an azalea tree, provided there is a 3×5×3 area above it that is clear of all blocks that are not leaves or logs.

An azure bluet can be broken instantly with any item or by hand, dropping itself.
An azure bluet also breaks if water or lava runs over its location, if a piston extends or pushes a block into its location, or if a block under the plant is moved or destroyed.

Natural generation[edit | edit source]
Azure bluets generate naturally on dirt and grass blocks in plains, sunflower plains, flower forest and meadow biomes as part of vegetation features. In Java Edition, they are also technically capable of growing in dripstone caves and deep dark biomes, though it is very unlikely due to lack of grass blocks in these biomes. In flower forests and meadows, azure bluets only generate as part of gradients.
Natural azure bluets are found in plains villages. Potted azure bluets can also be generated in woodland mansions.
Post-generation[edit | edit source]
Main article: Flower § Post-generation
Java Edition[edit | edit source]
When bone meal is applied to a grass block in a plains, sunflower plains, flower forest, meadow, dripstone caves, or deep dark biome, azure bluets have a chance of generating on the targeted block and adjacent grass blocks in a 15×5×15 area. In meadows and flower forests, azure bluets can generate only in specific locations depending on the flower gradient. In plains, sunflower plains, dripstone caves, and the deep dark, azure bluets cannot generate in tulip-only areas.
Bedrock Edition[edit | edit source]
When bone meal is applied to a grass block in a plains, sunflower plains, or flower forest biome, azure bluets have a chance of generating on the targeted block and adjacent grass blocks in a 7×5×7 area. In flower forests, azure bluets can generate only in specific locations depending on the flower gradient. In plains and sunflower plains, azure bluets cannot generate in tulip-only areas.
When bone meal is applied to an azure bluet in any biome, more azure bluets appear on top of nearby grass blocks. The flowers can appear up to 3 blocks away from the original, forming a 7×7 square.
Mob loot[edit | edit source]
In Java Edition, endermen can pick up azure bluets, like any other one-block-tall flower, and drop it if killed while holding it.
Trading[edit | edit source]
Wandering traders may sell an azure bluet for a single emerald.
Usage[edit | edit source]
Main article: Flower § Usage
Like other flowers, azure bluets can be used as decoration and planted on grass blocks, dirt, coarse dirt, rooted dirt, farmland, podzol, mycelium, moss blocks, mud, or muddy mangrove roots.
Azure bluets can also be placed in flower pots.

Suspicious stew[edit | edit source]
Main article: Suspicious Stew
Using an azure bluet to make suspicious stew, whether by direct crafting or by feeding a brown mooshroom and then milking it with a bowl, imbues it with a Blindness effect that lasts 11 seconds in Java Edition and 7 seconds in Bedrock Edition.

Bees[edit | edit source]
Bees engage in a pollinating behavior with azure bluets, increasing the honey level in beehives and bee nests by 1.
Breeding[edit | edit source]
Azure bluets can be used to breed, grow, and lead bees.
Bee nests[edit | edit source]
Oak, birch, and cherry trees grown from saplings that are within 2 blocks of an azure bluet have a 5% chance to grow with a bee nest and 2-3 bees in it.
Composting[edit | edit source]
Placing an azure bluet into a composter has a 65% chance of raising the compost level by 1. A stack of azure bluets yields an average of 5.94 bone meal.

There is a related tutorial page for this topic! 
See Tutorial:Bamboo farming.
Bamboo is a versatile, fast-growing plant found primarily in jungles, used for crafting (particularly scaffolding and bamboo wood), smelting, and breeding pandas.
A bamboo shoot is the initial non-solid sapling form of planted bamboo.

Obtaining[edit | edit source]
Bamboo shoots in item form cannot be obtained through vanilla means. In Bedrock Edition, they can be obtained through add-ons or inventory editing. In Java Edition, they do not exist as items and are thus completely unobtainable.
Breaking[edit | edit source]
Bamboo stalks can be mined with any tool, but an axe is quicker than other tools. Using a sword of any type breaks bamboo stalks and shoots instantly, even with Mining Fatigue. Flowing water also breaks bamboo shoots, but not mature bamboo stalks.

Natural generation[edit | edit source]
Main article: Bamboo (feature)
Bamboo generates in widely scattered single shoots within jungle biomes. Bamboo generates much more densely in the bamboo variants of jungles, covering large areas of the landscape. Bamboo does not generate in sparse jungles.[1]
Mob loot[edit | edit source]
In Java Edition, a panda drops 1 bamboo when killed. Looting does not affect the drop rate.[2]
In Bedrock Edition, a panda drops 0-2 bamboo when killed. Looting increases the drop by 1 per level.

Bedrock Edition

Shipwreck Supply chest 1–3 14.4%
Fishing[edit | edit source]
Bamboo can be found while fishing in jungle biomes as a junk item.
Usage[edit | edit source]
When broken, any bamboo block placed or grown above it is also broken. A bamboo block drops itself as an item if a piston pushes it or moves a block into its space. When bamboo is first placed as a shoot it’s not solid and can be destroyed by water flowing into it. After growing at least one block taller it becomes a solid stalk and cannot be destroyed by water. To transform a bamboo shoot into a solid bamboo block place another bamboo on top of it.
Unlike most plants, bamboo cannot be composted.[3]
Farming[edit | edit source]
Bamboo can be planted on moss blocks, grass blocks, dirt, coarse dirt, rooted dirt, gravel, mycelium, podzol, sand, red sand, suspicious sand, suspicious gravel, mud, muddy mangrove roots, bamboo shoot, or on itself. At default random tick speed (3), each plant grows on average every 4096 game ticks (204.8 seconds). When bone meal is used on it, it grows by 1–2 blocks. Bamboo can grow up to 12–16 blocks tall. The top of a bamboo plant requires a light level of 9 or above to grow.
Because bamboo breaks in almost the same way as sugar canes, a sugar cane farm can be easily adapted to this use. While water is not needed with such a farm, some spacing is recommended if the harvest is done manually as mature stalks are solid.
Pandas[edit | edit source]
Bamboo items are eaten by pandas and can be used to speed up the growth of baby pandas. Bamboo can also be used to breed pandas when at least 1 bamboo block (not a bamboo shoot) is within 5 blocks of the pandas, making the panda the only animal in the game to have extra breeding requirements. At this point, the player can feed them bamboo and they mate to have a baby.
Fuel[edit | edit source]
Bamboo can be used as fuel for smelting. Each bamboo item smelts 0.25 items.
Bamboo can be crafted into other items to increase its fuel efficiency.
By crafting a Block of Bamboo (9 bamboo) into 2 bamboo planks, 3 items can be smelted instead of 2.25, a 33.3% increase in efficiency.
In Bedrock Edition, the fuel efficiency can be further doubled by crafting the bamboo planks into twice the amount of slabs.[4]
Flower pots[edit | edit source]
Bamboo can be placed in a flower pot, where it retains the design it has in its item form.

Appearance[edit | edit source]
The different stages of bamboo growth.
The appearance of bamboo changes as it grows. When first placed, it takes the form of a small shoot that has no hitbox. When it grows one block taller its thickness increases to 2 pixels and the top block has leaves. At 3 blocks tall, the top two blocks have leaves. At 4 blocks tall, the bamboo thickness expands to 3×3 pixels. At 5 blocks tall, the top three blocks have leaves on them, and these blocks remain on top as the bamboo grows. Destroying a block of bamboo does not change the appearance of the blocks below it. Bamboo is oriented randomly in the block that it is in.

Issues[edit | edit source]
Issues relating to ""Bamboo"" are maintained on the bug tracker. Issues should be reported and viewed there.
Bedrock Edition
MCPE-60828 – Plants inside pots, especially potted bamboo and cactus, cannot be targeted at all
MCPE-62935 – Breaking bamboo creates bamboo sapling particle
MCPE-64930 – When walking towards bamboo while crouching, you are led to believe you can continue walking, which results in a fall.
MCPE-151709 – Z-fighting when bamboo is underneath leaves
MCPE-165012 – Horses do not make wood sounds when walking on Nether wood, bamboo wood, cherry wood, or stems
MCPE-170737 – Bamboo raft has an Z-fighting with some half blocks
MCPE-171537 – Most plants (flowers, saplings, grass) cannot be placed on sand or gravel, but bamboo can
MCPE-175805 – The side of bamboo fences that connect to blocks have a stretched texture
MCPE-189879 – Strip wood sounds do not play when stripping Nether stems, cherry logs, or bamboo blocks
Trivia[edit | edit source]
Because bamboo grows quickly (on average 1 growth per 200 seconds), just 500 plants in an automatic farm produce more items than a hopper can collect (2.5 items per second). A single hopper can move only enough items to keep 6.25 furnaces running.
Bamboo is the fastest-growing plant in Minecraft, which reflects its status as the fastest-growing plant known in real life.
While bamboo cannot be composted in Minecraft, it can be composted in real life.

Usage[edit | edit source]
Overlapping block on a banner.
Overlapping on a wall mounted banner.
There are 16 colored blank banners, and numerous patterns each available in 16 colors. A banner can be customized with up to 6 layers of patterns. The top layer of a banner (or the last pattern added) can be washed off by using it on a cauldron containing water.
Banners, much like signs, can be placed either on the ground facing in 16 directions, or on a wall. They gently sway as if affected by a breeze, regardless of dimension or location.
Other blocks (including other banners) can be placed on any edge of a banner's hitbox, which is only one block high despite the banner appearing as two blocks tall. When a banner is placed on the side of a block, its position is set by the top block. This makes it possible to overlap another solid block on the top half of a floor banner, or the bottom half of a wall banner.
Banners have no collision mask as they are completely non-solid, so entities can move through them.
Banners cannot be moved by pistons.
Water and lava flow around banners. In Bedrock Edition, banners can be waterlogged. Lava can create fire in air blocks next to banners as if the banners were flammable, but the banners do not burn (and cannot be burned by other methods).
Water can be placed below wall banners
Water flows around a banner on the ground
Patterns[edit | edit source]
See also: List of patterned banners
A banner may have up to six layers of patterns, which are overlaid with the last-added on top. Patterns can colored with any of the 16 dye colors.
A loom is used to add patterns. All patterns require a dye, but some of them also need a banner pattern item, which is not consumed in the process.
Loom recipes[show][edit]
In Bedrock Edition, most patterns can also be added through crafting, although this generally requires more dye and may also consume valuable items such as enchanted golden apples. Designs that require uncraftable banner pattern items (e.g. globe or gust) are not available through crafting.
Crafting recipes[show][edit]
Custom banner and shield designs can be preview using this tool:
Example of a banner with more than 6 patterns, a result of using the /give command.
In Java Edition, a banner can have more than six layers of patterns if obtained through commands (such as /give or /setblock) or external editors. A banner can visually display up to 16 layers. The item tooltip of a banner with more than 6 patterns lists only the first 6 bottom-most layers. Here is an example of a command that gives the player a banner with eight different patterns:
/give @s white_banner[banner_patterns=[{pattern:half_horizontal,color:red},{pattern:stripe_top,color:blue},{pattern:stripe_middle,color:pink},{pattern:stripe_bottom,color:cyan},{pattern:stripe_downright,color:yellow},{pattern:stripe_downleft,color:lime},{pattern:rhombus,color:orange},{pattern:skull,color:black}]]
In Bedrock Edition, banners with more than 6 layers are unobtainable via commands. Banners can display only up to 6 layers, even if more layers are added using external editors. Tooltips of such banners list all the layers.
Crafting ingredient[edit | edit source]
Shields can have patterns applied to them using banners. The shield pattern has a smaller resolution than the banner pattern, causing them to look different or offset.
Ingredients Crafting recipe
[hide]
Description
Shield +
Matching Banner


Applies the banner pattern to the shield. The banner is consumed.
The shield must have no preexisting patterns.
Does not change existing durability or enchantments on the shield.
Copying[edit | edit source]
Banners can be copied with a blank banner to make multiple identical banners. Banners with more than 6 patterns applied using commands cannot be copied in this manner.
Ingredients Crafting recipe
[hide]
Description
Matching Banner


Copies pattern; both banners must have the same base color, and the one having a pattern copied onto it must have no preexisting pattern.
Renaming[edit | edit source]
Like other items, banners can be renamed on an anvil. A banner retains its custom name when it is placed and retrieved, when a layer is added or removed, and when the banner is cloned; additionally, applying a renamed banner to a shield in Bedrock Edition gives the shield the custom banner name.
In Java Edition, a banner can also be given a custom name by using the /data command on a banner block to change its CustomName NBT tag.
Map marker[edit | edit source]
How every banner appears in Java Edition on a map, including a named banner.
This feature is exclusive to Java Edition. 
In Java Edition, pressing the use control on a banner while holding a map places a marker of the banner's position on the selected map, and pressing use on the banner again removes the marker. The marker has the same color as the banner's base without decorations. The marker is removed if the banner is destroyed unless the map is locked using a cartography table. If the banner is renamed, the name appears below the marker.
Helmet[edit | edit source]
This feature is exclusive to Java Edition. 
While a banner cannot be equipped in the head slot in Survival mode, equipping it using commands causes it to appear on top of the player. This is how raid captains wear banners.
Chestplate[edit | edit source]
This feature is exclusive to Bedrock Edition. 
While a banner cannot be equipped in the chestplate slot in Survival mode, equipping it using NBT editors causes it to appear on top of the player. This is how raid captains wear banners.
Fuel[edit | edit source]
Banners can be used as a fuel in furnaces, smelting 1.5 items per banner.
Note blocks[edit | edit source]
Banners can be placed under note blocks to produce ""bass"" sounds.

or approximately 1.47 quintillion. The number of visually distinct banners is smaller, because one or more patterns may completely cover other patterns or be duplicated.
A banner can have up to 16 layers of patterns with the use of commands. The total number of unique banners with at most 16 banner patterns is approximately 1.27 × 1046 (12.7 quattuordecillion), or exactly 12,696,344,039,844,551,126,101,565,750,244,757,433,489,827,856.
The Mojang logo is called ""Thing"" in-game, which could be considered an alternate translation for mojäng.
In the Swedish translation of the game, this pattern is, in fact, called mojäng.
Banner textures are located in \assets\minecraft\textures\entity\banner.
There are 40 monochrome textures, each containing all 6 sides of the banner.
The texture of the back side is the mirrored texture of the front side.
Compared to the texture files, textures' colors are inverted in-game due to them acting as masks for the re-colored base texture, base.png. That means white is visible, while black is transparent.

Usage[edit | edit source]
Barrels can be moved by pistons.‌[Bedrock Edition only] Water and lava flow around barrels without affecting them. Lava can create fire in air blocks next to barrels as if the barrel was flammable, but the barrel does not actually catch fire and can't be burned.
Container[edit | edit source]
The GUI of the barrel.
Barrels have a container inventory with 27 slots, which is the same as a single chest. Unlike chests, a barrel can be placed below a solid block and still be able to be opened. They can be filled by droppers and both filled and emptied by hoppers. When broken, barrels drop the contents of the container and the barrel item itself.
To open the barrel interface, use the Use Item control. To move items between the barrel inventory and the player inventory or hotbar while the barrel interface is open, drag or shift-click the items. Holding Shift and double-clicking while holding an item moves all items of the type clicked on in or out of the barrel to the extent that space is available for them.‌[Java Edition only] To exit the barrel interface, use the Esc control.
By default, the interface of a barrel is labeled ""Barrel"". A barrel's GUI label can be changed by naming the barrel in an anvil before placing it or by using the /data command‌[Java Edition only] (for example, to label a barrel at (0,64,0) as ""Bonus Barrel!"", use /data merge block 0 64 0 {CustomName:'""Bonus Barrel!""'}).
In Java Edition, a barrel can be ""locked"" by setting its Lock tag using the /data command. If a barrel's Lock tag is not blank, the barrel cannot be opened unless the player is holding an item with the same name as the Lock tag's text. For example, to lock a barrel at (0,64,0) so that the barrel cannot be opened unless the player is holding an item named ""Barrel Key"", use /data merge block 0 64 0 {Lock:""Barrel Key""}.
Profession[edit | edit source]
Main article: Job site block
If a barrel has not been claimed by a villager, any nearby unemployed villager has a chance to change their profession to fisherman and claim the barrel as their job site block.
Fuel[edit | edit source]
Barrels can be used as a fuel in furnaces, smelting 1.5 items per block.
Note Blocks[edit | edit source]
Barrels can be placed under note blocks to produce ""bass"" sounds.
Piglins[edit | edit source]
Piglins become hostile toward players who open or break barrels.

[NBT List / JSON Array] Items: List of items in the container.
[NBT Compound / JSON Object]: An item, including the slot tag. Barrel slots are numbered 0-26, 0 starts in the top left corner.

Obtaining[edit | edit source]
Barriers cannot be obtained in the creative mode inventory and are only obtainable via commands such as /give, /item in Java Edition, and /replaceitem in Bedrock Edition and cannot be broken in Survival mode.
In Java Edition, barriers are available in the Creative inventory if cheats are enabled and the ""Operator Items Tab"" setting is turned on.
Natural generation[edit | edit source]
In normal worlds, barriers do not generate naturally. In Java Edition, they generate as the floor in debug mode worlds.
Usage[edit | edit source]
The difference between air (top left) and barriers (bottom left) when ""show invisible blocks"" is enabled.
Barrier blocks are mainly used to build an impenetrable barrier that cannot be broken in standard Survival mode. For example, they can be used to protect a reserved area from entry by players, mobs, and other entities. Unlike other kinds of unbreakable blocks that could be used for this purpose (such as bedrock), barrier blocks are unobtrusive because they are invisible. Barrier blocks cannot be destroyed by TNT, creeper explosions, or any other explosions. Furthermore, they have a greater amount of blast resistance than any other unbreakable block.
Unlike other operator blocks such as command blocks, barriers can be placed by players in Survival mode.
In the player's inventory, the block is displayed as a red box with a slash through it, but when placed it is completely invisible.
Barriers are transparent to light and do not block beacons. Fences, iron bars, glass panes, and similar blocks do not visually connect with barriers. Barriers interact with blocks and mobs as a solid block. All dependent blocks can be placed on a barrier, such as torches or redstone, and it can suffocate mobs. Mobs cannot spawn on barriers.
In Creative mode, if a player is holding a barrier block in their hand, all placed barrier blocks display the barrier icon as a particle. This effect is client-side, and if a player holds a barrier block in Survival mode, the particle does not appear. Barrier blocks are not shown if the particle setting is set to ""minimal"".
Waterlogging[edit | edit source]
Barrier blocks can be waterlogged by being placed into a water source block or by manually using a water bucket on them. In Java Edition, water cannot be placed in them or taken out by non-direct interactions such as dispensers; this is allowed in Bedrock Edition. In Java Edition, only players in Creative mode can waterlog or remove water from barriers, while in Bedrock Edition there are no game mode restrictions. In Java Edition, water does not flow out of waterlogged barriers. See waterlogging for more details on what blocks can be waterlogged.
Piston interactivity[edit | edit source]
Barriers cannot be pushed by pistons. They also cannot be pushed nor pulled by sticky pistons.

Trivia[edit | edit source]
The symbol used is not compliant with ISO 3864-1, as the diagonal line is mirrored.[7]
Invisible bedrock, a technical block in Bedrock Edition, shares many features with the barrier block.
The barrier's vanilla block model defines only what texture to use for block breaking particles, and it does not have a parent model or anything that would give the block a physical shape.
Barriers are hardcoded to not render any block model.[8]

Natural generation[edit | edit source]
Basalt generates naturally as basalt pillars, which are found in the soul sand valley biome. They also generate in the basalt deltas biome as regular terrain and as part of basalt columns. In Java Edition, they also generate in blobs, which attempt to replace netherrack 75 times per chunk in blobs of radius 3—7, from levels 0 to 127, in basalt deltas biomes.
Basalt can also be found naturally as part of bastion remnants.
Post-generation[edit | edit source]
A simple basalt generator.
Basalt can also be made by lava flowing into a space that is on top of soul soil and adjacent to blue ice. The flowing lava is then replaced with basalt.
Usage[edit | edit source]
Basalt's only current use is as building material. Like logs and quartz pillars, basalt points perpendicular to whatever block face they are placed on.

Trivia[edit | edit source]
Geologically, basalt is a volcanic rock that cools from mafic lava flows. Mafic lava is runny, much like lava in the Nether, and under the right conditions it can cool into the stacks of basalt columns seen in basalt deltas.
Basalt makes up most of Earth's sea floor, as well as Iceland and the Hawaiian Islands.
Despite being an extrusive igneous rock, basalt has a lower mining time than granite and diorite, which are intrusive.
Basalt is the only rock-like block to have both a polished and smooth variant.

A beacon is a block that projects a beam skyward, and can provide beneficial status effects to players in a radius around it when placed on top of a solid pyramid base constructed from iron, gold, diamond, emerald or netherite blocks, from 9 blocks in size to 164 (2 stacks and 36).

Usage[edit | edit source]
When ""activated"", beacon blocks provide two unique functions:
A landmark beam reaching into the sky, which can be visible from far away.
Powers, which give players status effects within a certain range.
Additionally, in Bedrock Edition beacons can also be waterlogged.
Activation[edit | edit source]
The beacon base can be made of the different mineral blocks combined.
In order to activate a beacon, the beacon must meet the following requirements:
Beacons require an unobstructed view of the sky.
Transparent blocks (glass, water, etc.) and bedrock (the nether ceiling) are allowed.
The beacon is on top of a pyramid constructed from iron blocks, gold blocks, emerald blocks, diamond blocks, and/or netherite blocks.
The type of block used is purely cosmetic, having no effect on the pyramid's power level or the range and strength of the status effect. A mixture of blocks of different types can also be used in any orientation, so long as they form a pyramid structure, like the ones listed below.
Status effect range can be improved by increasing the pyramid power level (see chart below). At level 4, the pyramid gives the option to increase the primary effect's strength to Level II in the beacon's GUI.
Pyramids[edit | edit source]
For other pyramid structures, see Pyramid.
The four possible pyramid arrangements when using the beacon block. From left to right the pyramid structures decrease in complexity and strength.
Pyramids are the structures required to activate beacons. There are four possible pyramid heights. More pyramid levels make more powers available in a wider affected vicinity. The type of mineral block used to build the pyramid is entirely cosmetic and has no functional effect. Several different block types can be mixed without affecting functionality. If the pyramid is damaged so that the beacon deactivates, the previously-set powers resume their effects upon reactivation when the pyramid is repaired. This applies to piston-altered pyramids as well.
A single beacon pyramid

4 164 (2 stacks + 36 blocks) 1476 (23 stacks + 4 items) 9×9, 7×7, 5×5, 3×3, beacon
This six-beacon pyramid provides all six effects from a single structure using the fewest mineral blocks possible.
Multiple beacons can make use of the same specific mineral blocks below them. Combined pyramids do not need to be symmetrical. The image to the right shows a 6-beacon (2 by 3) pyramid. It requires a total of 244 mineral blocks, with a base layer of 10 by 11.

4 244 (3 stacks + 52 blocks) 2196 (34 stacks + 20 items) 10×11, 8×9, 6×7, 4×5, beacons
Beam[edit | edit source]
A vertical beam appears from a beacon if the beacon is activated, extending from the beacon block up to beyond the top of the world.
In Java Edition, the beam is visible up to 1343 blocks away.
In Bedrock Edition, the beam is visible up to 64 blocks away, regardless of how high the render distance is set.[1]
Colors[edit | edit source]
The color of the beam may be changed by placing blocks of stained glass or stained glass panes anywhere above the beacon block. The beam changes colors according to the colors of glass placed above it: the first block sets the beam color, while each additional block sets the color by averaging the red, green, and blue components of the current beam color and the block's color. The color values are the same as those for the corresponding dye. This also works using hardened stained glass and hardened stained glass panes.‌[Bedrock Edition and Minecraft Education only] Stained glass panes have the same effect on the beam as stained glass blocks.
The resulting beam color can be found as

Beacon beams cannot go through most blocks, but can go through bedrock (to allow beacons to be used in the Nether) and end portal frames.
Powers[edit | edit source]
See also: Effect
The GUI shown when pressing use on the block.
Once the beacon is emitting a beam, it can then be fed one iron ingot, gold ingot, emerald, diamond, or netherite ingot to select the status effects given to players within range of the beacon. This is done through the beacon's GUI, displayed by pressing use while looking at the beacon block. It doesn't matter which of the items is fed into the beacon.
In the GUI, the player places the item to be fed in the empty slot and clicks an effect from the ""Primary Power"" section on the left. If the beacon is sitting on a 4-level pyramid, the ""Secondary Power"" section on the right also becomes active. The player can then choose either to turn on the Regeneration power in addition to the Primary Power or to raise the primary power to Level II. The user clicks the ""Done"" button (green checkmark), the item is consumed, and the power(s) become activated, with the outline of the effect on the HUD having a blue outline.‌[JE only] To change the beacon's powers, this process must be followed again, consuming another ingot or gem.
If the pyramid is broken, effects deactivate or weaken depending on the level of the pyramid that is no longer complete. Upon restoration of the pyramid, the originally selected power returns without the need to spend another item. If a smaller pyramid is upgraded the effect range increases to that of the new pyramid without the need of reactivating it, upgrading to level 4 does not modify effect power.
The five primary powers are:
Speed I: Increased movement speed.
Haste I: Increased mining and attack speed.
Resistance I: Decreased nearly all incoming damage (2-level pyramid required).
Jump Boost I: Increased jumping distance and height (2-level pyramid required).
Strength I: Increased melee damage (3-level pyramid required).
The secondary powers available with a 4-level pyramid are:
Regeneration I: Regenerates health.
Increasing the primary power to level II.
It is also possible to combine two different primary Level I powers:‌[Java Edition only]
select a primary power in the left panel
select the Level II option in the right panel
select the second desired power back in the left panel
Only one of the two powers appear to be selected, although both effects are active.[2]
Every four seconds, the selected powers are applied with a duration of 9 seconds, plus 2 seconds per pyramid level, to all players in range. Thus, when powers are changed or a player travels outside the area-of-effect, the powers persist for 5–9 seconds, or 13-17 seconds with a full pyramid.
Range[edit | edit source]
The beacon affects an area in the shape of a square column, which reaches downward and out to each side at a range determined by the size of the pyramid base (see table below), and upward a distance of that range + the height of this dimension blocks.
The effect duration from the beacon is also determined by the size of the pyramid base (9 + Pyramid size * 2).
The range of the beacon effect is limited by the simulation distance. As such, on simulation distance of 4 with a level 4 pyramid, the effect does not reach the chunks on the corners of the beacon range.
The distance from the player to the beacon block does not affect the intensity of the status effect.
Pyramid size Effect radius
(blocks) Effect duration
(seconds)
1 level 20 11
2 levels 30 13
3 levels 40 15
4 levels 50 17
Light source[edit | edit source]
Beacon blocks can function as light sources, emitting a light level 15. Like other light sources, they melt snow and ice. A beacon produces this light even when it doesn't emit a beam.
Piston interactivity[edit | edit source]
Beacons cannot be pushed nor pulled by pistons or sticky pistons.

Block data[edit | edit source]
A beacon has a block entity associated with it that holds additional data about the block.
Java Edition:
See also: Block entity format
[NBT Compound / JSON Object] Block entity data
Tags common to all block entities[show]
[String] CustomName: Optional. The name of this container in JSON text component, which appears in its GUI where the default name ordinarily appears. Is not preserved when removed.[upcoming JE 1.21.5]
[String] Lock: Optional. When not blank, prevents the container from being opened unless the opener is holding an item whose name matches this string.
[String] primary_effect: Optional. The primary effect selected, see Potion effects for resource locations. Cannot be set to an effect that beacons do not normally use. Although Regeneration cannot normally be chosen as the primary effect, setting this value to minecraft:regeneration works and even allows Regeneration II to be chosen as the secondary via the normal beacon GUI.
[String] secondary_effect: Optional. The secondary effect selected, see Potion effects for resource locations. Cannot be set to an effect that beacons do not normally use. When set without a primary effect, does nothing. When set to the same as the primary, the effect is given at level 2 (the normally available behavior for 5 effects). When set to a different value than the primary (normally only Regeneration), gives the effect at level 1.

Usage[edit | edit source]
Sleeping[edit | edit source]
Player falling asleep in Java Edition.
Player falling asleep in Bedrock Edition.
Beds are used by pressing the use item button while looking at the bed.
A player sleeps by using a bed during a thunderstorm, or at night (between 12542 and 23459 ticks in clear weather, when stars appear in the sky, or between 12010 and 23991 ticks in rainy weather). Players can sleep during a thunderstorm even if they are in a biome where it does not rain (i.e. desert). Attempting to use a bed at any other time results in the message ""You can sleep only at night or during thunderstorms"" in Java Edition or ""You can only sleep at night and during thunderstorms"" in Bedrock Edition. A player sleeps in a bed for 101 in-game ticks, or 5.05 seconds before the time skips to the next day. Sleeping in a bed with the /gamerule doDaylightCycle set to false results in the player being kicked out of the bed after the 101 ticks, but does not change time of the world to day.
Sleeping in a bed is possible only in the Overworld. Attempting to sleep in a bed in the Nether, the End, and custom dimensions in which they are disabled causes it to explode and set fire to surrounding blocks.[2] The explosion has power 5, which is stronger than TNT (4), but not as strong as a charged creeper or end crystal (6). The explosion centers on the head part of the bed. Villagers can sleep normally in any dimension without the bed being blown up.[3] Upon death from a bed explosion, the message ""(Player) was killed by [Intentional Game Design]"" appears. In Bedrock Edition, bed explosions can be disabled by setting /gamerule respawnBlocksExplode to false; this still prevents beds to be used in invalid dimensions.
The player must be close to the bed to sleep. If the player is close enough to interact with the bed, but not close enough to sleep in it, the message ""You may not rest now, the bed is too far away"" in Java Edition or ""Bed is too far away"" in Bedrock Edition appears. To use a bed, a player must be within a distance of 3 blocks in Java Edition or 2 blocks in Bedrock Edition from the bed.
If a ""monster"" is within 8 blocks of the bed head horizontally (in the X- and Z-axis), and 5 blocks vertically (in the Y-axis), the message ""You may not rest now, there are monsters nearby"" appears and the player is prevented from sleeping until the monsters leave or are killed. Most hostile mobs, as well as some neutral mobs prevent players from sleeping, as shown in the table below.

If the player has not entered a bed and didn't die for 3 in-game days, phantoms can spawn unless /gamerule doInsomnia is set to false. In Java Edition, this can be verified by checking if the ""Time Since Last Rest"" statistic is greater than 1.00 h.
Taking damage from any source while in a bed causes the player to wake; this means players cannot sleep while on fire, while poisoned, or while starving, because the damage wakes them before they can fully fall asleep. Attacks from other players and hostile mobs also wake the player in this way, although the latter is rarely seen due to hostile mobs typically preventing the bed from being entered in the first place.
The player also cannot sleep in a bed occupied by another player, resulting in the message, ""This bed is occupied"".
A player can, however, sleep in a bed being used by a villager. The player may first wake the villager (pressing use on the villager) and then quickly enter the bed before the villager can lie down again. The villager reclaims the bed after the player wakes. The villager is kicked out of its bed when a player attempts to sleep there.
If all sleeping requirements are met and the player enters a bed, the player is positioned in the bed. The player falls asleep as the screen fades to black. In Bedrock Edition, the sleeping animation slowly lowers the player into bed.
Once all players in a world are asleep, after 5 seconds (100 ticks) the time of day changes to sunrise. (time 0)
During this time, the chat window is focused, and the player can leave the bed by clicking the Leave Bed button.
Waterlogged beds‌[Bedrock Edition only] cannot be slept in unless the player or villager has the Water Breathing or Conduit Power status effects. Attempting to use a waterlogged bed otherwise does not display any message.[5]
Beds displaying an error above the hotbar is a feature exclusive to beds; other blocks that cannot be used do not display such a message.[6]
The process for determining where to put the player after waking up is the same as for determining where to respawn the player after death (see below). The player attempting to sleep in a bed with no suitable wakeup positions (achievable by interacting with the bed from underneath it), such that the player will suffocate upon waking up, will result in the message ""This bed is obstructed"". The player always wakes up facing the head of the bed.
Villagers always wake up on top of the bed, meaning they can suffocate if there isn't enough room above the bed.
Passing the night[edit | edit source]
Sleeping changes the time of day to sunrise and resets the weather cycle, changing the weather to clear conditions. In Java Edition, the weather cycle resets only during rainy or snowy weather.
Sleeping does not accelerate processes that take place over time such as the growth of crops or smelting. If /gamerule doDaylightCycle is false, the player instead wakes up in the night.
To skip the night in multiplayer, all players in the Overworld must be in bed at the same time. Pressing the Leave Bed button is not necessary in this case. The percentage of players that need to sleep to skip the night can be customized with the game rule playersSleepingPercentage.
Villagers are unable to skip the night by sleeping in beds, unlike players.
Players and villagers do not drown or take damage from lava while in a bed, even if the bed is covered in lava. However, if the bed is destroyed while the player is in it, due to for example an explosion or by another player, the player wakes prematurely and the night does not pass.
Setting the spawn point[edit | edit source]
Once a player has entered a bed (or right clicked the bed during daytime), their spawn point is set to the location of that bed. Multiple players can set their spawn point on a single bed.
Using a bed in the daytime likewise sets the spawn point, without actually entering the bed.
When a bed explodes, it does not set the spawn point.
The message ""Respawn point set"" is displayed in chat when the respawn point is successfully changed.
The check for a bed is made only when the player respawns. This means that the bed can be destroyed and replaced or even reoriented, but as long as there is a bed present in the same location, the player can respawn there. If a player's bed is absent, or if the area around the bed is made unsuitable for respawning (see below), a message is displayed saying ""You have no home bed or respawn anchor, or it was obstructed"" in Java Edition or ""Your home bed was missing or obstructed"" in Bedrock Edition, and the player respawns at the world spawn point.
When choosing where to respawn the player, the two blocks to the immediate left and right of the head of the bed are considered first. Which block is chosen between the two corresponds to which direction the player was facing when they last interacted with the bed to set their spawn point; For example, a bed facing west will respawn the player on the south side of the bed if they are facing towards the north while setting their spawn point, and vice versa. If the player is perfectly aligned with the bed when the spawn point is set, the right side of the bed takes priority. Interacting with the bed again will still update which side of the bed is chosen for respawning, even if the location of the spawn point itself does not change.
Once a side is chosen, if the block immediately on the chosen side of the head of the bed is obstructed, the next block to be checked is chosen moving in a clockwise (right side) or counterclockwise (left side) direction around the bed. If all of the 10 blocks immediately adjacent to the bed are obstructed, the block above the head of the bed is checked, followed by the block above the foot of the bed. The player is always respawned facing the head of the bed, the same as for waking up.
For a location to be unobstructed, the block at the level of the bed must be air or non-solid (e.g. torches, but not glass) and there must be a space with a solid block below it and two non-colliding blocks for the player to stand in 0-2 blocks below the bed. It does not matter if the bed itself has blocks above it. Putting a slab one block above a bed can act as a two block tall space, as the bed is half a block tall. The bed never spawns the player directly below itself even if all other locations are obstructed. If a bed is obstructed, the player's spawn point is cleared after they respawn. That is, even if the bed is subsequently made usable again, the player continues to respawn at the world spawn until interacting with the bed again.
Specifically, when interacting with it, the location of the head of the bed is saved as the spawn point, and if a bed is in that space (whether it is the foot or the head) then the respawn works. This can be observed by reorienting the bed with its head in the same location. Interacting with it does not produce a ""Respawn point set"" message as the game doesn't change the saved spawn point. If a bed is reoriented so that its foot is in this space, it still functions on the next respawn, but it can also be interacted with to update the spawn point to the new head of the bed and cause a ""Respawn point set"" message. Attempting the reverse, reorienting the bed so that it overlaps the original location of the foot, results in a respawn at world spawn. However, the location of the foot of the bed is also saved. If the bed is moved so that part of it overlaps the original location of the head, it can be observed that the same locations need to be obstructed to stop spawning. It is possible to respawn 2 blocks away from the bed this way.
Bouncing[edit | edit source]
Falling onto a bed bounces the player with 66% strength – the bouncing-up velocity is 66% of the impact velocity. The player also takes less fall damage when bouncing on a bed. The player's fall distance is set to 50% of the actual distance fallen, which usually results in the player taking less than half of the normal fall damage.
Baby villagers bounce on beds during the day.
If the player is falling while sleeping requirements are met, and presses use on a bed within reach before hitting the ground, the fall damage is delayed until the player wakes.
A player can bounce on a bed while another player or villager is sleeping on it without waking the player or the villager up.
Villagers can be pushed onto beds, as the bed is half a block tall.
Curing[edit | edit source]
Each bed in the vicinity of a zombie villager has a chance to speed up the process of curing the zombie villager. Iron bars (such as in a prison cell) also have this effect.
Placement[edit | edit source]
Beds require two blocks of floor space. Placement requires at least 2 blocks from the player's facing direction. When placed, the foot of the bed is placed on the block selected and the head of the bed on the block farther away from the player. In Bedrock Edition, beds require solid blocks below them when placed. However, the bed remains in place if its supporting blocks are later removed. In Java Edition, beds do not require supporting blocks and can be placed anywhere, provided there is enough room.
Explosions[edit | edit source]
See also: Tutorials/Ancient Debris § The bed method and Tutorials/Defeating the ender dragon § Beds
Because beds explode in the Nether and the End, they can be used as any other explosion, to demolish blocks or deal damage. Explosions can be used, for example, to mine for ancient debris or to kill the ender dragon.
In Bedrock Edition, beds do not explode if /gamerule respawnBlocksExplode is set to false.

Please expand the section to include this information. Further details may exist on the talk page.
September 16, 2010 Notch was considering adding beds as a block to reset spawn points, making up ""some interesting economics"" with this.
November 26, 2011 Jeb mentioned that crying obsidian was intended to act as a block to reset spawn points as well.

Java Edition Beta
1.3 Added beds.
The only color for beds is red.
Beds can be crafted using any color combination of wool.
When a player goes to sleep, the game attempts to spawn up to 20 zombies, skeletons, or spiders in a 32x16x32 area centered on the bed. For each mob that spawns successfully, the game attempts to find a valid path from the mob to the player's bed; if one is found, the mob is teleported next to the bed and the player woken up without skipping to morning.
Trying to sleep in a bed in the Nether does nothing.
1.4 Sleeping in a bed now resets the player's spawn position, though it does not work for most users. The spawn point unintentionally changes only if Leave Bed button (only available in multiplayer at the time) is clicked.
1.4_01 Beds now set the player's spawn point as intended, both in singleplayer and in multiplayer.
1.6 Test Build 3 Trying to sleep in a bed in the Nether now causes the bed to explode.
1.7 As blocks now pull textures from the expected places for model application, this has resulted in the bed texture shifting downward in terrain.png. No visual difference has resulted for the actual bed.

Issues[edit | edit source]
Issues relating to ""Bed"" are maintained on the bug tracker. Issues should be reported and viewed there.
Trivia[edit | edit source]
The reason beds explode in the Nether and the End is because Notch found it was the easiest solution to dimension-unique respawning.[16]
Dimension-unique respawning was eventually implemented via the respawn anchor, and gained command support at the same time. Despite this, beds and respawn anchors still explode in invalid dimensions.
If the player quits the game while sleeping, upon return the player wakes up beside the bed.
Using the /teleport command while another player is sleeping still teleports the sleeping player, but the player wakes immediately.‌[Java Edition only]
If the player places a bed on ice, running over the bed acts like running over ice, similar to slabs.
When placed using the /setblock command, only one half of a bed is placed, because beds are two blocks long. A single half can be slept in like a whole bed.
Villagers can sleep in the Nether and the End without causing the bed to explode.[17]
While the block state used to determine the half of a two-block block such as doors and double-tall flowers is called half, in the case of beds this is called part.
The red bed was the original default bed color. In Java Edition 1.12 and Pocket Edition 1.1.0 version of the game, the default color was changed to white.

Bedrock cannot normally be broken in Survival mode with any tool. However, it can be broken using glitches involving a piston, but it does not drop as an item unless you use another glitch. It can also be broken with an explosion, because its blast resistance is only 3.6M.
In Java Edition 22w13oneBlockAtATime, bedrock is breakable in Survival, taking 15 minutes to break with empty hands and without a Haste effect applied.
Natural generation[edit | edit source]
Bedrock comprises the five bottom-most layers of the Overworld and the Nether in a rough pattern, although the top four layers are predominantly flat bedrock with only rare gaps, rendering the lowest, completely flat fifth layer (at Y=-64) mostly inaccessible. The distribution of bedrock is dependent on world seed.
In the Nether, bedrock additionally comprises the top five layers in a rough pattern. At the top of the Nether (Y=127), the layer is composed solely of bedrock, preventing the player from ascending above Y=127 without switching gamemode to creative or spectator, or exploiting glitches. The patterns of bedrock are consistent in the Nether in Java and Bedrock editions.
In the End, a single block of bedrock generates on top of each end spike, each topped with an end crystal. The bedrock remains after the destruction of the crystal and is lit on fire indefinitely. Bedrock additionally comprises part of the exit portal at the center of the central island. Unlike in other dimensions, there is no bedrock floor at the bottom of the End, meaning it is possible to fall into the void without exploiting glitches.
An unlimited number of end gateways generate randomly across the outer End islands, each consisting of 12 blocks of bedrock.
Post-generation[edit | edit source]
If the bedrock that makes up the exit portal is removed by any means, it regenerates when the ender dragon is defeated or re-summoned.
An end gateway is generated on the central End island upon the death of each ender dragon, which is mostly made of bedrock. A total of 20 of these gateways generate in a circle centered on the exit portal in set positions. A corresponding end gateway is generated in the inner edge of the outer islands after an end gateway on the central island is activated for the first time.
Usage[edit | edit source]
Bedrock generated at the bottom of the Overworld and the Nether prevents players from falling into the void.
The bedrock ceiling in the Nether is intended to prevent players from accessing the space above Y=127, which is meant to be an empty out-of-bounds area. In Bedrock Edition, players cannot build in the space above the bedrock layer at Y=127. In Java Edition, the space between the top bedrock layer and Y=255, known as the Nether roof, functions identically to the rest of the Nether in terms of mob spawning and building for players, which is an intended feature.[1]
Bedrock generated around the end gateways and the exit portals protects them from being broken and keeps them accessible and usable.
Mobs do not spawn on bedrock. Endermen are unable to place the block they are holding onto bedrock.
Beacons treat bedrock as a transparent block, meaning their beams can pass through it, allowing beacons to be used in the Nether.
In the End, any fire on bedrock never extinguishes naturally, similar to netherrack.
Trapping the wither[edit | edit source]
Main article: Tutorials/Wither cage
Since bedrock is indestructible in Survival, it can be used against withers. Certain configurations of bedrock (such as that found under the exit portal) can be used to securely trap withers by spawning them below the bedrock. The wither can then be easily killed, utilized to break blocks automatically, or used to farm wither roses.
End crystal[edit | edit source]
Bedrock is one of the only two blocks on which end crystals can be placed, the other being obsidian. Placing four end crystals on bedrock around the exit portals triggers respawning the ender dragon.
Placing an end crystal on bedrock in the End sets it on fire.
Note blocks[edit | edit source]
Note blocks can be placed above bedrock to produce ""bass drum"" sounds.
Piston interactivity[edit | edit source]
Bedrock is unable to be pushed or pulled by either of the piston variants (regular or sticky).

Outside of Minecraft, ""bedrock"" means any solid rock beneath the soil layer (i.e. anything below dirt, sand, gravel. etc.). In real life, bedrock is breakable.
Strongholds and the end portal can override generated bedrock.
The bedrock texture, in both the Default and Programmer Art resource packs, is a variant of the stone block with increased contrast.
Vexes and the ender dragon can fly through bedrock. Additionally, the ender dragon cannot break bedrock.

Breaking[edit | edit source]
See also: Tutorials/Honey farming § Avoiding Bee Anger
Bee nests can be broken by any tool or by the player's fist, though they break faster with an axe.
If a bee nest is broken with a tool not enchanted with Silk Touch, it drops nothing and any bees inside emerge angry at the player, stinging them and causing poison. Nearby bees will also become angry and attack. If a Silk Touch tool is used, the bee nest drops itself and any bees inside remain inside, and any bees nearby do not become angry.
If broken in Creative mode with bees inside, the bee nest drops itself and bees inside remain inside.

Natural generation[edit | edit source]
A naturally generated bee nest in a village in a Superflat world.
Naturally generated bee nests generate with 2-3 bees in them. The bee nests always face south.
Bee nests generate in the following biomes with different chances:
Biome Chance[note 1]
Java Edition Bedrock Edition
Meadow
100%
Cherry grove 5% Unknown
Plains
Sunflower plains
5%
Mangrove swamp
1%
Flower forest 2% 3%
Forest
Birch forest
Old growth birch forest 0.2% 0.035%
↑ The chance for each naturally-generated oak, birch, mangrove tree, or cherry tree to have a bee nest.
Post-generation[edit | edit source]
Oak, birch, or cherry trees grown from saplings that are within 2 blocks (including diagonally) of a flower on the same Y-level have a 5% chance to grow with a bee nest containing 2–3 bees. This holds true in any biome in any dimension, and for any flower including wither roses and flowering azaleas.
Mangroves grown from mangrove propagules have a 1% chance of having a bee nest containing 2-3 bees. Unlike birch, cherry and oak trees, no flowers are required for a bee nest to generate.[1]
Usage[edit | edit source]
Bee housing[edit | edit source]
Dripping honey.
Bee nests and beehives can house up to 3 bees at a time. They can enter through any unobstructed side, top, or bottom, but can exit only from the front, and only if it's unobstructed by a solid block (including a non-full solid block in Bedrock Edition).
Bees fly into a nest or hive at night, during rain, and after loading up with pollen from a flower. They first look for one at the same coordinates as the last one they entered, but if there's no nest or hive there, or it already contains 3 bees when they arrive, they search the nearby area for another one.
Igniting a nest or hive allows any bees inside to escape, possibly catching fire as they flee.
Harvesting[edit | edit source]
See also: Tutorials/Honey farming
Bees are protected from a campfire by placing a carpet over it in Java Edition.
Once full, bee nests and beehives provide two harvestable products: honey and honeycomb.
Each time a bee enters a nest or hive covered in pollen, it starts converting it to honey and honeycomb. After it's done, it waits for daylight with no rain (if necessary), then exits to go collect more pollen. If the bee hive or nest is in the Nether or in the End the bee exits as soon as it converts the pollen. When the bee exits, the hive increments its honey level by 1 and has a 1% chance to increment it by 2. Once it has the maximum honey level of 5, it changes its appearance to show honey oozing out and, if the block below it isn't a full solid block, starts dripping honey particles. (The dripping honey is decorative; it cannot be collected in a cauldron.) These changes signal that the hive or nest is ready for harvesting.
To harvest honey, the player uses a glass bottle on the nest or hive; the bottle then becomes a honey bottle. To harvest honeycomb, the player uses shears on the nest or hive, causing it to drop three honeycomb items. After harvesting, the hive or nest is reset to empty (honey level 0, with the default appearance).
Alternatively, honey or honeycomb can be harvested by powering a redstone dispenser containing either a glass bottle or shears. The dispenser must be placed beside and facing the hive or nest.
This is the maximum distance a beehive can be from a campfire while applying the calming effect (5 blocks).
Harvesting from a beehive or bee nest causes any bees inside it to become aggravated toward the player, unless there is a fire directly beneath it or a lit campfire within five blocks below, and the smoke is not obstructed. Smoke can pass through no more than one solid block, and only if that block is directly above the campfire. Placing a carpet above the campfire leaves room for the bees to hover beneath the nest and still avoid taking fire damage. In Java Edition, the smoke coming through the carpet also calms the bees. In Bedrock Edition, a carpet is treated as an obstruction that removes the calming effect of the campfire's smoke. Without a block covering the fire, the bees can still avoid fire damage if the campfire is placed 4–5 blocks below the nest.
Redstone component[edit | edit source]
Beehives and bee nests have comparator output with a strength equal to the honey level in the block. Once the beehive or bee nest is filled with honey it emits a signal strength of five.
Note blocks[edit | edit source]
Beehives and bee nests can be placed under note blocks to produce ""bass"" sound.

A beehive is a craftable block that houses bees. They fill with honey as bees pollinate flowers and return to their homes and, when full, can either be sheared for honeycombs or honey bottles extracted using glass bottles.

Breaking[edit | edit source]
See also: Tutorials/Honey farming § Avoiding Bee Anger
Beehives can be broken by any tool or by the player's fist, though they break faster with an axe. When mined, they always drop themselves.
If a beehive is broken with a tool not enchanted with Silk Touch, any bees inside and nearby emerge angry at the player. If a Silk Touch tool is used, any bees inside remain inside and any other bees nearby do not become angry.
If broken in Creative mode with bees inside, the beehive drops itself and bees inside remain inside.

Usage[edit | edit source]
Bee housing[edit | edit source]
Dripping honey.
Bee nests and beehives can house up to 3 bees at a time. They can enter through any unobstructed side, top, or bottom, but can exit only from the front, and only if it's unobstructed by a solid block (including a non-full solid block in Bedrock Edition).
Bees fly into a nest or hive at night, during rain, and after loading up with pollen from a flower. They first look for one at the same coordinates as the last one they entered, but if there's no nest or hive there, or it already contains 3 bees when they arrive, they search the nearby area for another one.
Igniting a nest or hive allows any bees inside to escape, possibly catching fire as they flee.
Harvesting[edit | edit source]
See also: Tutorials/Honey farming
Bees are protected from a campfire by placing a carpet over it in Java Edition.
Once full, bee nests and beehives provide two harvestable products: honey and honeycomb.
Each time a bee enters a nest or hive covered in pollen, it starts converting it to honey and honeycomb. After it's done, it waits for daylight with no rain (if necessary), then exits to go collect more pollen. If the bee hive or nest is in the Nether or in the End the bee exits as soon as it converts the pollen. When the bee exits, the hive increments its honey level by 1 and has a 1% chance to increment it by 2. Once it has the maximum honey level of 5, it changes its appearance to show honey oozing out and, if the block below it isn't a full solid block, starts dripping honey particles. (The dripping honey is decorative; it cannot be collected in a cauldron.) These changes signal that the hive or nest is ready for harvesting.
To harvest honey, the player uses a glass bottle on the nest or hive; the bottle then becomes a honey bottle. To harvest honeycomb, the player uses shears on the nest or hive, causing it to drop three honeycomb items. After harvesting, the hive or nest is reset to empty (honey level 0, with the default appearance).
Alternatively, honey or honeycomb can be harvested by powering a redstone dispenser containing either a glass bottle or shears. The dispenser must be placed beside and facing the hive or nest.
This is the maximum distance a beehive can be from a campfire while applying the calming effect (5 blocks).
Harvesting from a beehive or bee nest causes any bees inside it to become aggravated toward the player, unless there is a fire directly beneath it or a lit campfire within five blocks below, and the smoke is not obstructed. Smoke can pass through no more than one solid block, and only if that block is directly above the campfire. Placing a carpet above the campfire leaves room for the bees to hover beneath the nest and still avoid taking fire damage. In Java Edition, the smoke coming through the carpet also calms the bees. In Bedrock Edition, a carpet is treated as an obstruction that removes the calming effect of the campfire's smoke. Without a block covering the fire, the bees can still avoid fire damage if the campfire is placed 4–5 blocks below the nest.
Redstone component[edit | edit source]
Beehives and bee nests have comparator output with a strength equal to the honey level in the block. Once the beehive or bee nest is filled with honey it emits a signal strength of five.
Note blocks[edit | edit source]
Beehives and bee nests can be placed under note blocks to produce ""bass"" sound.

Axes are considered the preferred tool,[1] and swords would also increase the breaking speed,[2] however these ultimately have no impact due to the instant default mining speed.
Natural generation[edit | edit source]
Village farm plots have a chance of being beetroots. The exact chance depends on the style of the village:

Usage[edit | edit source]
Farming[edit | edit source]
See also: Crop farming
Beetroot seeds can be planted on farmland to create a plant that grows through 4 stages of growth. The seeds require a light level of 8 or greater to plant‌[Java Edition only] and 9 or greater to grow. In Bedrock Edition they can be planted at any light level, but need a internal light level of 9 to grow. When fully grown, the plant can be broken to harvest beetroot seeds and beetroots.
While beetroot crops have only four growth stages compared to eight for wheat, carrots and potatoes, each growth tick has a 1⁄3 chance of not advancing the growth stage and therefore beetroot grows slightly faster than other crops.
Crops grow faster if the farmland they are planted in is hydrated. One application of bone meal has a 75% chance of advancing growth by one stage. This is less effective than for other crops: an average of 5 1⁄3 are needed to fully grow beetroot compared to 2 2⁄7 for other crops.
Crops break if pushed by a piston or if their supporting farmland breaks or turns to dirt (e.g. by being trampled), dropping their usual drops.
Breeding[edit | edit source]
Like other seeds, beetroot seeds can be used to breed chickens, lead chickens around, and make baby chickens grow up faster by 10% of the remaining time.
Taming[edit | edit source]
Like other seeds, beetroot seeds can be used to tame parrots.
Composting[edit | edit source]
Placing beetroot seeds into a composter has a 30% chance of raising the compost level by 1.

Breaking[edit | edit source]
A bell can be mined with anything, but pickaxes are the fastest. A bell also breaks and drops itself if a piston extends or pushes a block into its location, or if the block the bell is attached to is moved or destroyed.

Usage[edit | edit source]
Bells can be anchored to the side of blocks, ceilings, and floors and drop as an item if the sustain block is broken or moved by a piston. They can also be attached to trapdoors but break if the trapdoor is opened.
When the use control is pressed while looking at the side of a bell, it produces a sound as well as a ""swaying"" animation. A bell can also be rung using a redstone signal, by any projectile, or by dropping an item on it. ‌[Bedrock Edition only]
If the player rings the bell while villagers are sleeping, all of the villagers wake up. Bells can be rung by players only from certain angles (villagers are not subject to this restriction); trying from an incorrect angle does not cause the bell to ring.
Villagers ring the bell only during raids.
Claiming[edit | edit source]
A villager can detect a bell within 48 blocks euclidean distance horizontally and 6 block vertically (either up or down) from the base of his hitbox and can claim it if he gets within 6 blocks taxicab distance of it and there is a valid path that can lead them to be in the block right besides the bell. Baby villagers do not claim nor ring a bell.
When villagers spawn and have not already claimed a bed or workstation, they will automatically claim any bell 6 blocks from them, even if they cannot reach it. Additionally, when a bell is placed within 48 blocks from the pillow of a claimed bed and there is a valid path a villager can walk through, the bell gets automatically claimed in the afternoon (between 9000t and 12000t), which is displayed by green particles appearing above the bell. This does not work with claimed workstations.
Claimed bells are POIs and determine the position of a village center among claimed beds and workstations.
When a player subject to the Bad Omen effect enters a village with a bell, the claiming mechanisms are forced no matter the time, meaning that if the bell is close enough either from a villager or from a claimed bed, it becomes part of the village.
A claimed bell defines a gathering site of a village, and villagers pathfind close to it in the afternoon.
If the bell is broken, anger particles appear above the village leader's head.‌[Bedrock Edition only]
If a player rings a bell, the villagers run to their houses even if there is no raid. Villagers can activate a bell even through blocks, but only if it was previously claimed and at least 2 blocks (also diagonal) from the base of their hitbox.
Raid[edit | edit source]
See also: Tutorials/Defeating a village raid
When the bell is rung, villagers within a distance of 32 blocks run to the nearest bed within 32 blocks immediately.
In Java Edition, when a raid's first wave appears, at least one villager rushes to ring the bell in the center of the village (if they are close enough) to warn the other villagers of an incoming raid before going into their house. In Bedrock Edition, bells in the corresponding village ring automatically at the start of a raid, warning villagers to return to their houses.
Glowing effect[edit | edit source]
In Java Edition, if a bell is rung and there is a raid mob within a 32 block spherical range, the Glowing effect is applied to all raid mobs within 48 blocks for 3 seconds, and particles appear. It produces a resonating sound once this process is complete. The raid mobs do not have to be actively participating in a raid to receive the Glowing effect; the effect applies to illagers in woodland mansions, or witches that naturally spawn in the Overworld.
Piglins[edit | edit source]
Piglins admire bells as golden items. However, breaking a bell does not aggravate them.[1]
Redstone component[edit | edit source]
In Java Edition, bells ring one time upon receiving a redstone signal. Observers can detect when a bell receives a redstone signal, and when it stops receiving a signal (corresponding to the powered block state). Observers cannot detect when a bell is activated by the player or other entities. Sculk sensors, however, can detect a bell being rung in any way, or when placed or broken. Bells are transparent blocks and cannot be powered.
In Bedrock Edition, observers can detect when a bell is rung. Observers do not emit a signal when the bell stops ringing or becomes unpowered.

Bells with wall attachments are now properly implemented, no longer not having models. An oddity regarding their states is that their facing state corresponds to the direction they attach to, as opposed to the block face they attach to (an oddity shared with cocoa).
Bells with two wall attachments have also been added.
Bells now generate in the updated desert and taiga villages.
Added sounds for bells.
Bells now have a shaking animation when hit.
19w03a More cullface arguments have been added to bell model.
19w11a Bells are now sold by armorer, toolsmith and weaponsmith villagers, making them renewable.
Bells now ring when hit by some projectiles, but not all.[more information needed]
19w13b Hitting a bell now gives the glowing effect to raiders within a 32-block-radius of the bell.
Pre-Release 3 The models of bells has been changed.
1.15 19w36a Bells now ring if powered with a redstone signal.
1.16 20w11a Bells now ring when hit by any projectile.
20w16a Bells now generate in ruined portal chests.
20w22a Bells now do not need a completely full face to hang from, and as such can be attached to the bottom face of many more blocks.[2]
1.21.4 24w44a Bells now drop when broken with any tool. Before, they needed at least a wooden pickaxe, or to have their supporting block removed.

Bedrock Edition
1.9.0 beta 1.9.0.2 There are unused bells with the side textures of granite, polished granite and diorite that can be obtained via commands. These are without a doubt due to rotation metadata being misinterpreted as variant data, as granite, polished granite and diorite are simply metaadata variants of stone in this version.
1.10.0 beta 1.10.0.3 The bells with stone variant textures also generate in the new villages.
1.11.0 beta 1.11.0.1 The bells with granite, polished granite and diorite textures have been removed.

Trivia[edit | edit source]
In Bedrock Edition, bells deflect any projectile that does not disappear when hitting a surface (arrows or tridents).
In Bedrock Edition, when holding down right-click while looking at a bell and holding an item with a right-click action, the bell rings once and then the player uses the item.[3]
If a villager tries to give another villager food near a bell, there is a chance it might hit the bell with the food and cause all the villagers to run, thrower included.‌[Bedrock Edition only]

Usage[edit | edit source]
Potatoes of knowledge[edit | edit source]
Big brains absorb nearby experience orbs. When broken, a big brain drops a potato of knowledge with a knowledge amount equal to how much experience it absorbed (if it didn't absorb anything, potato of knowledge still drops, with 0 knowledge). Maximum possible amount stored in a single potato of knowledge is equal to 1000 experience points; if big brain absorbs this much experience, a potato of knowledge with 1000 experience is dropped by it automatically, without breaking the block.
Piston interactivity[edit | edit source]
Big brains cannot be pushed or pulled by pistons.
Note blocks[edit | edit source]

A big dripleaf is a plant that generates within lush caves. Its leaf is a temporary platform; when stood on, it tilts down and drops its burden, resetting a few seconds later.

Breaking[edit | edit source]
Big dripleaves can be obtained with any tool, but an axe is fastest. It also breaks when pushed with a piston or sticky piston. Breaking it at any spot on the plant causes the entire plant to collapse.
Destroying a big dripleaf plant drops one big dripleaf for each stem block and the leaf.

Natural generation[edit | edit source]
Big dripleaves naturally generate within lush caves biome.
Post-generation[edit | edit source]
Bone meal can be used on a small dripleaf plant to turn it into a big dripleaf up to 5 blocks tall, as long as there is enough open space above it. Using bone meal on a big dripleaf plant makes it one block taller, creating an extra stem block (see #Growth).
Renewability[edit | edit source]
As wandering traders sell small dripleaves for an emerald. Applying bone meal to small dripleaves turns them into big dripleaves, making them renewable.
Usage[edit | edit source]
Big dripleaves consist of any number of non-solid stem blocks atop of each other and a single leaf as the uppermost block, which can be stood on by any entity like a normal block for 1 second (20 game ticks). After this time, it tilts down, becoming lower than a block and giving a player warning that it is about to collapse. After a few ticks, it tilts down and becomes temporarily non-solid.
When the leaf is powered by redstone, it does not tilt or collapse. Powering the stem has no effect.
One-block tall big dripleaves can be used to make the player crawl. If a player is standing inside a big dripleaf when it is fully tilted, and the dripleaf returns to the untilted position, the player is left crawling underneath the leaf.
When directly hit with any projectile, the leaf immediately becomes temporarily non-solid. This cannot be prevented by powering it with redstone.
Frogs enjoy jumping on big dripleaves, although the dripleaf tilts down and drops the frog, unless the dripleaf is powered by redstone.
Placement[edit | edit source]
Big dripleaves can be placed only on top of clay, coarse dirt, dirt, farmland, grass blocks, moss blocks, mud, muddy mangrove roots, mycelium, podzol, and rooted dirt. Until Java Edition 1.21.5, they can also be planted on pale moss blocks. Big dripleaves can also be placed underwater. A big dripleaf is always one block tall when placed.
Growth[edit | edit source]
Using bone meal on a big dripleaf makes it grow 1 block taller, unless there is a block above the leaf other than air or water. Unlike most plants, dripleaf does not grow by itself: bone meal must be applied for growth to occur.
Composting[edit | edit source]
Placing a big dripleaf into a composter has a 65% chance of raising the compost level by 1.

History[edit | edit source]
October 3, 2020 Dripleaves (named as Dripleaf Plant) are announced at Minecraft Live 2020.
November 27, 2020 The big dripleaf has a new texture in a tweet from Agnes Larsson.

Java Edition
1.17 21w05a Added dripleaves
21w06a Big Dripleaves can no longer be broken with arrows in spawn protection.[1]
No longer stop tilting while sneaking on, jumping on, or even jumping off it.
Now tilt quicker.
Now tilt when hit by projectiles, instead of being broken.
Big dripleaf can be used with redstone: powering a dripleaf now prevents it from tilting down. Powering an already tilted dripleaf tilts it back up. Powering a dripleaf down allows it to tilt down again. Powering a dripleaf does not prevent tilting because of projectiles.
Interestingly, the block does not save if it is powered unlike anything else that reacts to redstone.
21w07a The model of the big dripleaf has been changed.
21w10a Big dripleaves can now generate in lush caves.
21w11a Breaking the stem of a big dripleaf now drops the block.
Applying bone meal to a dripleaf stem makes it grow.
21w13a The model of the big dripleaves has been tweaked that the texture of the underside of the leaf flipped from to .
21w20a Tweaked the big dripleaf's inventory model.
1.18 21w43a Big dripleaves can now be placed only on clay, coarse dirt, dirt, farmland, grass blocks, moss blocks, mycelium, podzol, and rooted dirt.
1.19 22w15a Big dripleaves can now be planted on mud.[2]

Usage[edit | edit source]
The big sign functioned effectively the same as a regular sign, however the model was stretched to the width of three blocks. The big sign allowed for more characters to be included per line, due to the increased width.

Natural generation[edit | edit source]
Blackstone generates naturally in the Nether, particularly in the basalt deltas biome, below the surface of a lava sea, and anywhere underground.
Blackstone can be found as a part of bastion remnants.
Ore blobs of blackstone attempt to replace netherrack 2 times per chunk in blobs of size 0 to 160, from levels 5 to 31‌[JE only]/36‌[BE only], in all Nether biomes except basalt deltas.
In Java Edition, blackstones also generate in big blobs, which attempt to replace netherrack 25 times per chunk in blobs of radius 3—7, from Y-levels 0 to 127, in basalt deltas biome.
Bartering[edit | edit source]
Piglins may barter 8-16 blocks of blackstone when given a gold ingot.
Usage[edit | edit source]
Blackstone can be used as a substitute for cobblestone in the Nether as it can be used to craft stone tools, brewing stands, and furnaces. It can also be used to repair stone tools using an anvil. It can also be used to craft polished blackstone.
Blackstone cannot be used to craft dispensers, droppers, pistons, or other blocks that use cobblestone in their recipes.[1]

A blast furnace is a block that smelts ores, raw metals and metal armor and tools twice as quickly as a furnace, but cannot smelt anything else. It also serves as an armorer's job site block.

Usage[edit | edit source]
Blast furnaces can be pushed by pistons.‌[Bedrock Edition only]
Smelting[edit | edit source]
The GUI for the blast furnace, same as the ordinary furnace's.
Main article: Smelting
Blast furnaces are similar to furnaces, but can smelt only raw metal, ore blocks and tools/armor made of iron, gold or chainmail. Blast furnaces serve as the counterpart to smokers, which are used mainly to cook food faster. Smelting equipment yields one iron or gold nugget from their respective materials. Once an item and a fuel are placed into the blast furnace, the block state changes to lit and the item is smelted twice as fast as a regular furnace. Fuel is also used at double the rate of regular furnaces, so the number of items smelted per fuel stays the same. The product can then be collected by using the output. Like normal furnaces, a hopper can be used to feed items into or collect items from a blast furnace.
Profession[edit | edit source]
Main article: Job site block
If a blast furnace has not been claimed by a villager, any nearby unemployed villager has a chance to change their profession to armorer and claim the blast furnace as their job site block.
Light source[edit | edit source]
Blast furnaces emit a light level of 13 when active, similar to normal furnaces.
Custom name[edit | edit source]
By default, the interface of a blast furnace is labeled ""Blast Furnace"", but this name can be customized by naming it in an anvil before placing it, or by changing the CustomName tag using the /data command.‌[Java Edition only]
Lock[edit | edit source]
In Java Edition, a blast furnace can be ""locked"" by setting its Lock tag using the /data command. If a blast furnace's Lock tag is not blank, the blast furnace cannot be opened unless the player is holding an item with the same name as the Lock tag's text. For example, to lock a blast furnace at (0,64,0) so that the blast furnace cannot be opened unless the player is holding an item named ""Blast Furnace Key"", use /data merge block 0 64 0 {Lock:""Blast Furnace Key""}.
Note blocks[edit | edit source]
Blast furnace can be placed under note blocks to produce ""bass drum"" sounds.

Beacons[edit | edit source]
Blocks of amber can be used to ""power"" a beacon. The beacon can be powered by a 3×3 square of amber blocks underneath it, and can optionally also include a 5×5, 7×7, and 9×9 layer in the shape of a pyramid under the original layer to increase the effects from the beacon. The layers do not have to be entirely blocks of amber, as they may also contain blocks of iron, blocks of gold, blocks of diamond, blocks of netherite or blocks of emerald.

Usage[edit | edit source]
Sound[edit | edit source]
Uniquely among other blocks, a block of amethyst makes a quiet overlay sound when generally interacted with, as well as its block breaking sound when hit with a projectile.
Vibration resonance[edit | edit source]
When a block of amethyst is placed adjacent to a sculk sensor or a calibrated sculk sensor, if that sculk sensor receives a vibration, the block of amethyst re-emits its frequency as a separate vibration at its location. This vibration can then be detected by another sculk sensor, allowing a chain of sculk sensors and amethyst blocks to be created, transmitting a signal wirelessly.

Stripping[edit | edit source]
Using an axe on a block of bamboo turns it into a block of stripped bamboo.
Fuel[edit | edit source]
Blocks of bamboo can be used as a fuel in furnaces, smelting 1.5 items per block.
The efficiency of using bamboo as fuel depends on how it is crafted. 9 bamboo can smelt 2.25 items, whereas a block can smelt only 1.5 items. However, the block can be crafted into 2 bamboo planks, which together can smelt 3 items.
Unlike logs, blocks of bamboo cannot be smelted into charcoal.[1]

Fuel[edit | edit source]
Blocks of coal can be used as fuel in a furnace. One block of coal lasts 800 seconds (16000 ticks), which smelts 80 items. This is ten times the duration of a single piece of coal and 11⁄9 times as efficient (+11.11%) as nine individual pieces of coal, which would only smelt 72 items. The latter, however, prevents inactive furnace use; while smelting one item with one coal wastes seven potential items, smelting one item with one block of coal wastes 79 potential items.
Note blocks[edit | edit source]
Blocks of coal can be placed under note blocks to produce ""bass drum"" sounds.

Java Edition
2.0 Added blocks of coal to the April Fool's 'update', Minecraft 2.0, using a recolored version of the Block of Redstone texture. It could not be used as fuel and was only a compact block. When crafted back to coal, it would have an item data value of 32767 instead of 0, so it could not be stacked with other coal.
April 5, 2013 Coal blocks mentioned by Dinnerbone,[1] after their featuring in Minecraft 2.0. These would apparently be difficult to implement due to an analogous block made of charcoal requiring a separate block ID due to ""logical issues"".
1.6.1 13w18a Added blocks of coal.
Blocks of coal utilize the same texture as from the April Fools' Day update.
The smelting time for block of coal is 720 seconds.

Trivia[edit | edit source]
Blocks of coal cannot be used as fuel for the minecart with furnace.
A full stack of coal blocks should smelt for 14.2 hours – over 42 Minecraft days. That is over 50 times as many items as a lava bucket. However, the player needs 576 coal or 9 stacks of coal to do this.

A block of copper, internally known as a copper block, is a block that oxidizes over time, gaining a verdigris appearance over four stages. They can be prevented from oxidizing by being waxed with honeycombs. Non-oxidized, non-waxed blocks of copper are storage blocks equivalent to nine copper ingots.

Honeycomb


Waxing[edit | edit source]
Blocks of copper can be turned into the respective waxed copper blocks by using a honeycomb item on them. Waxed copper blocks do not oxidize and are identical to the non-waxed version.
Scraping[edit | edit source]
Using an axe on a waxed block of copper turns it into the respective non-waxed block of copper. In addition, using an axe on an exposed, weathered, or oxidized block of copper reverts it one stage to a regular, exposed, or weathered copper block respectively.
Scraping with an axe is not possible when holding a shield in the offhand, so that combat is not affected when the player is near waxed or oxidized copper blocks.[1]
Lightning strike[edit | edit source]
Non-waxed blocks of copper are completely deoxidized when struck by lightning, and other non-waxed blocks of copper nearby are deoxidized randomly.
Usage[edit | edit source]
Blocks of copper can be used to store copper ingots in a compact fashion. Exposed, weathered, and oxidized variants cannot be crafted back into copper ingots, but the unoxidized waxed block variant can. Unlike the cut variant, blocks of copper cannot be crafted directly into slabs or stairs without a stonecutter. Stonecutting blocks of copper gives four times more products than typical for stone, and allows slabs and stairs to be obtained.

Oxidation[edit | edit source]
Main article: Oxidation
Non-waxed blocks of copper have four stages of oxidation (including the initial normal state). Lightning bolts and axes can remove the oxidation from blocks of copper. They can be waxed with a honeycomb to prevent the oxidation from progressing.
As the block begins to oxidize (exposed copper), it gets discolored and green spots begin to appear. As the oxidation continues (weathered copper), the block is a green color with brown spots. In the last stage (oxidized copper), the block is teal with several green spots.

Spawning mobs[edit | edit source]
Whenever a block of corrupted potato peels receives a random tick, it has 5% chance to spawn a random entity on top of itself. Various entities have different probabilities for being spawned:
Entity Probability
Enderman 50%
Poisonous potato zombie 40%
Poisonous potato item 8%
Batato 1.9%
Ghast 0.1%
For an entity to spawn, there must not be any living entity already on the block. Entities are spawned regardless of light level, player proximity, or presence of solid blocks on top of the block of corrupted potato peels.

Usage[edit | edit source]
Blocks of diamond can be used to store diamonds in a compact fashion.
Beacons[edit | edit source]
Blocks of diamond can be used to ""power"" a beacon. The beacon can be powered by a 3×3 square of diamond blocks underneath it, and can optionally also include a 5×5, 7×7 and 9×9 layer in the shape of a pyramid under the original layer to increase the effects from the beacon. The layers do not have to be entirely diamond blocks, as they may also contain blocks of iron, blocks of gold, blocks of netherite, and blocks of emerald.

The layers do not have to be entirely made with blocks of gold, as they may also contain blocks of iron, blocks of emerald, blocks of netherite, and blocks of diamond.
Note blocks[edit | edit source]
Blocks of gold can be placed under note blocks to produce bell sounds.
Piglins[edit | edit source]
Piglins become distracted upon the player dropping a block of gold as an item, and become enraged if the player breaks a block of gold near them.

Trivia[edit | edit source]
In Xbox 360 Edition, before TU19, four blocks of gold stacked on top of an obsidian block could be found inside the tutorial world's desert pyramid. This is a reference to Achievement Hunter's Let's Play Minecraft series, in which this combination is used to create the ""Tower of Pimps"" (seen right), a structure first created by Gavin Free, which is now used in many episodes as a trophy.
If one block is considered to be equal to one cubic meter, then one block of gold has a mass of 19,320 kilograms, making it the heaviest real-world matter available in vanilla Minecraft if element blocks are not considered. A player's inventory has 37 slots (including the offhand slot), and each can carry 64 blocks of gold; therefore, a player can carry a maximum number of 45,749.76 metric tons of weight, not considering armor or putting things in shulker boxes (theoretically increasing the weight by 27 times).

Iron Ingot

Usage[edit | edit source]
Blocks of iron can be used to store iron ingots in a compact fashion.
Beacons[edit | edit source]
Blocks of iron can be used to ""power"" a beacon. The beacon can be powered by a 3×3 square of iron blocks underneath it, and can optionally also include a 5×5, 7×7 and 9×9 layer in the shape of a pyramid under the original layer to increase the effects from the beacon. The layers do not have to be entirely blocks of iron, as they may also contain blocks of gold, blocks of diamond, blocks of netherite or blocks of emerald.
Spawning iron golems[edit | edit source]
Iron golem build configuration.
Blocks of iron and pumpkins‌[Bedrock Edition only], carved pumpkins or jack o'lanterns are used to build iron golems. The pumpkin, carved pumpkin or jack o'lantern must be placed last, and the golem spawns immediately after placing it.

Netherite Ingot

Usage[edit | edit source]
Blocks of netherite can be used to store netherite ingots in a compact fashion.
A single block of netherite contains enough netherite ingots to upgrade a full set of diamond armor and five diamond weapons or tools.
Blocks of netherite have a blast resistance of 1,200, the same as obsidian, crying obsidian, ancient debris, respawn anchor, anvils, and enchanting tables. Unlike obsidian, blocks of netherite (and ancient debris) can be moved with pistons, which makes it useful in redstone builds. Furthermore, blocks of netherite have a hardness of 50, the same hardness as obsidian, crying obsidian, and respawn anchors. This makes it the hardest block to be able to be pushed by a piston. However, these blocks can be destroyed by explosions while being pushed or pulled by pistons.‌[Java Edition only][1] They can also be destroyed by explosions when in item form.[2]
It can be destroyed by a wither's blue skulls and on contact with a wither.
Beacons[edit | edit source]
Blocks of netherite can be used to power a beacon. The beacon can be powered by a 3×3 square of netherite blocks underneath it, and can also optionally include a 5×5, 7×7 and 9×9 layer in the shape of a pyramid under the original layer to increase the effects from the beacon. The layers do not have to be entirely netherite blocks, as any combination of blocks of iron, blocks of gold, blocks of diamond, blocks of emerald, or netherite blocks can power a beacon.

Trivia[edit | edit source]
A single block of netherite is made from 9 netherite ingots, each composes of 4 netherite scraps and 4 gold ingots. Therefore, a block of netherite is made of 36 pieces of ancient debris and 36 gold ingots.
To construct a beacon pyramid consisting entirely of blocks of netherite, a total of 5904 pieces of ancient debris are needed, which is 92 1⁄4 stacks, capable of filling almost three and a half shulker boxes.

Trivia[edit | edit source]
Because of the low blast resistance of regular quartz blocks, it may be preferable to use two quartz slabs or smooth quartz blocks when making fortifications using quartz, as their blast resistance is higher than the other quartz block variants.
In real life, a 1-cubic-meter block of quartz (the size of a Minecraft block) is practically harder than the real life block of iron, while the mining speed of block of quartz in Minecraft is quite low.

Redstone Dust

Usage[edit | edit source]
A block of redstone can be used as a redstone power source and can be crafted back into redstone dust. It can also be used as storage if the player's inventory is full of redstone dust from mining.
Crafting ingredient[edit | edit source]
Blocks of redstone can be crafted back into redstone dust, and thus provide compact storage for redstone, like other blocks of materials (block of iron, block of gold, etc.).

Redstone component[edit | edit source]
A block of redstone powers dust and repeaters, deactivates attached torches, and activate mechanisms (left) – but does not power adjacent opaque blocks (right).
See also: Redstone circuit
To place a block of redstone, use the Place Block control.
Blocks of redstone are always active and cannot be turned off. A block of redstone:
powers any adjacent redstone dust, including above or below, to power level 15
powers any adjacent redstone comparators or redstone repeaters facing away from the block of redstone to power level 15
activates any adjacent mechanism components (doors, redstone lamps, etc.), including above or below, with the exception of pistons, which cannot be activated by any power source directly in front of them
Adjacent opaque blocks are not powered.
If a redstone torch is attached to a block of redstone, it deactivates after 1 redstone tick and does not reactivate (which is normal behavior for a redstone torch attached to a powered block).
A block of redstone can be moved by a piston. Water and lava flow around a block of redstone without affecting it.

Resin Clump

Usage[edit | edit source]
Because blocks of resin can be broken instantly without any tool, and do not have unusual interactions like slime block, honey block or TNT, they can be used as a temporary building block that is easy to place and break.[1]

Editor31/Block,"Some of the most common blocks in Minecraft, clockwise from the left: stone, sand, dirt, and grass.
Blocks are the basic units of structure in Minecraft that make up the game's world. Many blocks can be collected and placed anywhere, as well as be used as helpful resources.

Behavior[edit | edit source]
A variety of different blocks occurring in an underwater coral reef; sand can be seen lining the ground, cut sandstone in underwater ruin structures and various forms of coral.
Blocks are arranged in a 3-dimensional grid of 1-cubic-meter cells, although some blocks appear to occupy a partial cell; these include slabs, snow layers, ladders, vines, stairs, turtle eggs, and sea pickles, among others.
Collectively, blocks and fluids make up the in-game environment, and most can be harvested and utilized in various fashions. Some blocks, such as dirt and sandstone, are opaque and occupy their entire cubic meter, while others, such as glass and flowers, are transparent or non-solid. Explosions destroy some blocks more easily than they destroy others, while some are virtually immune to explosions. They can still be theoreticlly exploded.
Air is a special block that acts as a substitute for the absence of blocks. It has two variants: cave air and void air.‌[Java Edition only]
Some blocks, such as sea lanterns and glowstone, emit light, the amount of which varies widely; see this table of light values for further information. Opaque blocks completely block light, while transparent blocks have no effect on light, block the light, or merely weaken it.
Almost all blocks ignore gravity, except for sand, red sand, gravel, anvils of all damage levels, dragon eggs, all colors of concrete powder, scaffolding, snow layers‌[BE only], pointed dripstone, suspicious sand, and suspicious gravel. These turn into entities when their support is removed.
When broken, blocks emit sounds and particles associated with themselves, except in the following cases:
When the block is removed by a piston.[1]
If the block is affected by gravity and falls into an invalid space (If the block is gravity based and drops onto a torch, for example).[2]
Anvils that are destroyed by running out of durability or falling. Only particles are missing.[3]
If the block can be washed away and is washed away by a flowing fluid.[4]
If the block can be replaced by other blocks and is replaced.[5]
If the block is one of a few blocks such as rails or redstone wire, supported by another block and its supporting block is removed.[6]
If the block is leaves and decays.[7]
Block height[edit | edit source]
Main article: Solid block § Height
Most solid blocks are 1 meter high (3.28084... feet or 1250⁄381 feet), but several blocks have non-standard block heights, such as slabs.
A player can automatically step up from a lower to a higher height if the difference is at most 0.6 (3⁄5) of a block or 1.9685... feet (250⁄127 feet).
Textures[edit | edit source]
Main page: User:Editor31/List of block textures
The textures on the faces of most blocks are 16×16 pixels. Exceptions include candles, sculk sensors, etc. Most blocks are proportionately one cubic meter by default, but their shape can be changed using models.
Most blocks have static textures, but these blocks are animated: water, lava, nether portal, end portal, end gateway, prismarine (slab; stairs; wall), sea lantern, magma block, seagrass, kelp, fire, lantern, lit campfire and their soul variants, lit blast furnace, heat block‌[BE & edu only], stems, hyphae, lit smoker, stonecutter, sculk, sculk shrieker, sculk sensor, calibrated sculk sensor, sculk vein, and command block.
Players can change their textures by changing their files in-game. The following explains how. In the title screen, go to ""Mods and Texture Packs"", then click the texture pack, then click ""Done"".
If there is none, click ""Open texture pack folder"". This redirects you to the game directory. If you have a file or folder containing the texture pack, move it here. Go back to the game, exit the menu, and then enter to the ""Mod and Texture Packs"" option again. Your file should now be there. Drag it as described in the first point above.
Using texture packs, the player can change the textures and resolution of blocks, including whether their texture is animated. They can also change the shapes of blocks using models and the size of blocks to any size with equal width and height, though sizes that are a power of two tend to work better.

Block additions and removals[edit | edit source]
This section is missing information about: New Nintendo 3DS additions - many pages say blocks were added to Creative mode as the first history mention of them but don't say when they were actually added to the game, even as potentially unobtainable blocks. 
Please expand the section to include this information. Further details may exist on the talk page.
Unique blocks are defined as having unique namespaced IDs in current versions of Java Edition, excluding obvious technical variants such as potted plants and wall attachments of blocks, but including the rose. Unintentional metadata variants are also not included.

Issues[edit | edit source]
Issues relating to ""Block"" are maintained on the bug tracker. Issues should be reported and viewed there.
Trivia[edit | edit source]
Certain blocks may interpret positions they cannot be placed in by normal means as a valid position. For example, a sign placed in midair via /setblock remains in midair even when updated, until either it is broken, or a block is placed below it and broken.

Katso Category:Finnish translation/Kuutiot, lista aiheeseen liittyvistä sivuista.
Joitain Minecraftin yleisimpiä kuutioita, myötäpäivään vasemmalta: kivi, hiekka, multa ja ruoho.
Kuutiot ovat Minecraftin rakenteen perusyksiköitä, joista pelimaailma koostuu. Monia kuutioita voi kerätä ja asettaa minne tahansa ja käyttää hyödyllisinä resursseina.

Käyttäytyminen[edit source]
Valikoima eri kuutioita, joita löytyy vedenalaiselta koralliriutalta. Hiekka muodostaa maanpinnan, leikattu hiekkakivi vedenalaisten raunioiden rakenteessa ja korallin eri muotoja.
Kuutiot ovat järjestäytyneet 3-ulotteiseen ruudukkoon, joka koostuu 1 kuutiometrin soluista, vaikka jotkin kuutiot näyttävät täyttävän osittaisen solun. Näihin kuuluvat laatat, lumikerrokset, tikkaat, köynnökset, portaat, kilpikonnan munat, tulitelat sekä monia muita.
Yhdessä kuutiot ja nesteet moudostavat pelin ympäristön ja suurinta osaa niistä voi kerätä ja hyödyntää eri tarkoituksiin. Jotkin kuutiot, kuten multa ja hiekkakivi ovat opaakkisia ja täyttävät koko kuutiometrinsä, kun taas toiset, kuten lasi ja kukat ovat läpinäkyviä tai ei-sileitä. Räjähdykset tuhoavat joitain kuutioita helpommin kuin toisia, kun taas jotkin ovat itse asiassa immuuneja räjähdyksille. Ne voidaan kuitenkin teoriassa räjäyttää.
Ilma on erikoiskuutio, joka vastaa kuution puuttumista. Sillä on kaksi varianttia: luolailma ja tyhjiöilma.‌[vain Java Edition]
Jotkin kuutiot, kuten merilyhdyt ja hehkukivi tuottavat valoa, jonka määrä vaihtelee paljon, katso tämä taulukko valoarvoista saadaksesi lisää tietoa. Opaakkiset kuutiot estävät valon kokonaan, kun taas läpinäkyvillä kuutioilla ei ole vaikutusta valoon, ne estävät valon tai pelkästään heikentävät sitä.
Melkein kaikki kuutiot eivät huomioi painovoimaa, poikkeuksena hiekka, punahiekka, sora, kaikkien vahinkotasojen alasimet, lohikäärmeen munat, kaikenväriset betonijauheet, rakennustelineet, lumikerrokset‌[vain BE], terävä tippukivi, epäilyttävä hiekka ja epäilyttävä sora. Nämä muuttuvat olioiksi, kun niiden tuki poistuu.
Tuhoutuessaan kuutiot tuottavat niihin liittyviä ääniä ja partikkeleita pitsi seuraavissa tilanteissa:
Kun mäntä poistaa kuution.[1]
Jos painovoima vaikuttaa kuutioon ja se tippuu virheelliseen tilaan (Esim. jos painovoima vaikuttaa kuutioon ja se tippuu soihdun päälle).[2]
Alasimet, jotka tuhoutuvat kestävyyden loppumisesta tai tippumisesta. Vain partikkelit puuttuvat.[3]
Jos kuutio voi huuhtoutua ja virtaava neste huuhtoo sen.[4]
Jos kuution voi korvata muilla kuutioilla ja se korvataan.[5]
Jos kuutio on yksi muutamista kuutioista, kuten raiteet tai redstone-johto, jota toinen kuutio tukee ja sitä tukeva kuutio poistetaan.[6]
Jos kuutio on lehdet ja mädäntyy.[7]
Kuution korkeus[edit source]
Pääartikkeli: Sileä kuutio § Korkeus
Suurin osa sileistä kuutioista on 1 metrin korkuisia (3,28084... jalkaa tai 1250⁄381 jalkaa), mutta useilla kuutioilla on ei-standardikuutiokorkeuksia, kuten laatoilla.
Pelaaja voi automaattisesti nousta alemmalta ylemmälle korkeudelle, jos ero on enintään 0,6 (3⁄5) kuutiota tai 1,9685... jalkaa (250⁄127 jalkaa).
Tekstuurit[edit source]
Pääartikkeli: Luettelo kuutioiden tekstuureista
Suurimman osan kuutioista sivujen tekstuurit ovat 16x16 pikseliä. Poikkeuksena kynttilät, sculk-sensorit, yms. Suurin osa kuutioista on oletuksena yksi kuutiometri, mutta niiden muotoa voi muuttaa käyttämällä malleja
Suurimmalla osalla kuutioista on staattiset tekstuurit, mutta seuraavat kuutiot ovat animoituja: vesi, laava, nether-portaali, end-portaali, end-portti, prismariini (laatta, portaat, muuri), merilyhty, magmakuutio, meriruoho, rakkolevä, tuli, lyhty, palava nuotio ja sen sieluvariantti, palava masuuni, lämpökuutio‌[vain BE & edu], rungot, rihma, palava savustin, kivileikkuri, sculk, sculk-kirkuja, sculk-sensori, kalibroitu sculk-sensori, sculk-suoni ja komentokuutio.
Pelaajat voivat vaihtaa tekstuurejaan vaihtamalla niiden tiedostoja pelissä. Seuraava kertoo, miten. Valikossa valitse ""Asetukset"" ja sitten ""Resurssipaketit"". Kaksi paneelia ilmestyy: ""Saatavilla"" ja ""Valittuna""(Oletus-resurssipaketin tulisi olla ""Valittuna"" alla).
Jos joku resurssipaketti on kohdassa ""Saatavilla"", vedä se kohtaan ""Valittuna"" ja klikkaa sitten ""Valmis"" Resurssipaketin tulisi olla aktiivisena hetken päästä.
Jos siellä ei ole mitään, klikkaa ""Avaa pakettikansio"". Tämä uudelleenohjaa sinut pelihakemistoon. Jos sinulla on resurssipaketin sisältävä tiedosto tai kansio, siirrä se tänne. Palaa peliin, poistu valikosta ja valitse ""Resurssipaketit""-valinta uudestaan. Tiedostosi pitäisi olla nyt siellä. Vedä se yllä olevan ensimmäisen kohdan ohjeiden mukaan.
Resurssipaketteja käyttämällä pelaaja voi vaihtaa kuutioiden tekstuureja ja resoluutioita mukaan lukien, onko tekstuuri animoitu vai ei. He voivat myös muuttaa kuutioiden muotoja käyttämällä malleja ja kuutioiden kokoa miksi tahansa samalla leveydellä ja korkeudella, vaikka ko'oilla, jotka ovat kahden potensseja, on tapana toimia paremmin.

Block additions and removals[edit source]
This section is missing information about: New Nintendo 3DS additions - many pages say blocks were added to Creative mode as the first history mention of them but don't say when they were actually added to the game, even as potentially unobtainable blocks. 
Please expand the section to include this information. Further details may exist on the talk page.
Unique blocks are defined as having unique namespaced IDs in current versions of Java Edition, excluding obvious technical variants such as potted plants and wall attachments of blocks, but including the rose. Unintentional metadata variants are also not included.

Trivia[edit source]
Certain blocks may interpret positions they cannot be placed in by normal means as a valid position. For example, a sign placed in midair via /setblock remains in midair even when updated, until either it is broken, or a block is placed below it and broken.

Beteende[edit source]
En mängd olika block som förekommer i ett undervattenskorallrev; sand kan ses längs med marken, skuren sandsten i undervattensruinstrukturer och diverse former av koraller.
Block är arrangerade i ett Tredimensionellt rutnät av 1 kubikmeters celler, även om vissa block verkar delvis ockupera en cell; dessa omfattar plattor, snö lager, stegar, klätterväxter, trappor, sköldpaddsägg och havsgurkor med flera.

Tillsammans utgör block och vätskor spelmiljön och de flesta kan skördas och utnyttjas på olika sätt. Vissa block, såsom jord och sandsten, är ogenomskinliga och ockuperar hela deras kubikmeter. Medan andra, såsom glas och blommor. är transparenta eller icke fast. Explosioner förstör vissa block enklare än andra, medans vissa är så gott som imuna imot explosioner. De kan fortfarande teoretiskt sätt exploderas med en tillräckligt stark explosion.
Luft är ett specielt block som agerar som en ersättning för frånvaron av block. Den har two varianter: grottluft och tomluft.[Endast Java Edition]
Vissa block, såsom havslyktor och glödsten, ger ifrån sig ljust där mängden av ljus varierar kraftigt; kolla på denna tabell av ljusvärden för mer information. Ogenomskinliga block blockerar ljus helt och hållet medans transparenta block har ingen verkan på ljus, blockerar ljuset eller endast försämrar det.
Nästan alla block ignorerar gravitation, förutom sand, röd sand, grus, städ av alla skade nivåer, drakägg, alla färger av betongpulver, byggnadsställning, snö lager[Endast BE], spetsig droppsten, misstänksam sand och misstänksamt grus. Dessa omvandlas till entiteter när deras stöd är borttaget.
När blocken går sönder avger de ljud och partiklar förknippade med sig själva, förutom i följande fall:
När blocket är borttaget av en kolv.[1]
Om blocket är påverkat av gravitation och faller in i ett ogiltigt utrymme (Om blocket är gravitations baserad och faller på en fackla till exempel).[2]
Städ som är förstörda genom att få slut på hållbarhet eller att falla. Endast partiklar fattas.[3]
Om blocket kan sköljas bort och är bortsköljd av en strömmande vätska.[4]
Om blocket kan ersättas av andra block och är ersatt.[5]
Om blocket är ett av några få block såsom räls eller redstonetråd, stöds av ett annat block och dess stödblock tas bort.[6]
Om blocket är löv och sönderfaller.[7]
Block höjd[edit source]
Huvudartikel: Fast block § Höjd
De flästa fasta block är 1 meter höga (3,28084... fot eller 1250/381 fot), men ett flertal block har ej standard blockhöjd, såsom plattor.
En spelare kan automatiskt gå upp från en lägre till en högre höjd om skillnaden är som mest 0,6 (3/5) av ett block eller 1,9685... fot (250/127 fot).

Texturer[edit source]
Huvudartikel: Lista över blocktexturer
Texturerna på sidorna av de flesta block är 16x16 pixlar. Undantag inkluderar stearinljus, sculksensorer etc. De flesta block är proportionellt en kubikmeter som standard men deras form kan ändras med användning av modeller.
De flesta block har stillastående texturer, medans dessa är animerade: vatten, lava, netherportal, endportal, endpassage, prismarin (platta, trappa, mur), havslyckta, magmablock, kelp, eld, lyckta, tänd lägereld och dess själ varianter, tänd masugn, värmeblock[Endast BE & edu], stammar, hyfer, tänd rökugn, stenskärare, sculk, skulkskrikare, sculksensor, kalibrerad sculksensor, sculkven och kommandoblock.
Spelare kan ändra deras texturer genom att ändra på deras filer i spelet. Följande förklarar hur. I menyn gå till ""Alternativ"", sedan välj ""Resurspaket"" alternativet. Två paneler visas: ""Tillgängliga"" och ""Valda"" (Standard resurspaketet borde vara under ""Valda"").
Om det finns något resurspaket under ""Tillgängliga"" dra det till ""Valda"", tryck sedan på ""Klar"". Resurspaketet borde vara aktivt innom något ögonblick.
Om det inte finns några tryck på ""Öppna mappen för paket"". Detta omdirigerar dig till spelkatalogen. Om du har en fil eller map som innnehåller resurspaketet flytta det hit. Gå tillbaks till spelet, lämna menyn och sedan gå in i ""Resurspaket"" alternativet igen. Din fil borde nu vara där. Dra den som beskrivet i första punkten åvan.
Med användning av resurspaket så kan spelaren ändra texturen och upplösningen av block, inklusive om deras textur är animerad. Man kan också ändra formen av block med använding av modeller och storleken av block till vilken som helst med samma bredd och höjd, men storlekar som är en potens av två tenderar att fungera bättre.

Block additions and removals[edit source]
This section is missing information about: New Nintendo 3DS additions - many pages say blocks were added to Creative mode as the first history mention of them but don't say when they were actually added to the game, even as potentially unobtainable blocks. 
Please expand the section to include this information. Further details may exist on the talk page.

Packed Ice

It takes 81 regular ice made into packed ice to create a single blue ice block.
Trading[edit | edit source]
Wandering traders have 1⁄6 chance to sell blue ice for 6 emeralds.
Usage[edit | edit source]
Blue ice is slippery, causing most entities to slide, including items. It is even more slippery (0.989) than ice or packed ice (0.98). This allows for increased speed of items in water currents by placing the blue ice under the water current. Mobs do not travel faster in water currents on blue ice.
Boats can travel even faster on blue ice than on either normal ice or packed ice, being able to reach a top speed of 72.73 m/s (as opposed to 40 m/s on ice and packed ice). Ice tracks built from blue ice, packed ice, or a combination are useful for long-range travel in all three dimensions.
Blue ice is a completely solid block and allows the placement of any objects on top.
Unlike normal ice, blue ice does not melt when placed near light sources.
Blue ice can be used to create basalt. When lava flows into a space above soul soil and next to blue ice, basalt is formed. This can be used in a basalt generator.
Blue ice is not a storage block, as it cannot be crafted back into packed ice.

Natural generation[edit | edit source]
Blue orchids generate naturally on dirt and grass blocks in swamps as part of vegetation features.
Potted blue orchids can also be found in woodland mansions.
Post-generation[edit | edit source]
Main article: Flower § Post-generation
When bone meal is applied to a grass block in a swamp biome, blue orchids have a chance of generating on the targeted block and adjacent grass blocks in a 15×5×15 area in Java Edition, or a 7×5×7 area in Bedrock Edition.
In Bedrock Edition, when bone meal is applied to a blue orchid in any biome, more blue orchids appear on top of nearby grass blocks. The flowers can appear up to 3 blocks away from the original, forming a 7×7 square.
Mob loot[edit | edit source]
In Java Edition, endermen can pick up blue orchids, like any other one-block-tall flower, and drop it if killed while holding it.
Trading[edit | edit source]
Wandering traders may sell a blue orchid for a single emerald.
Usage[edit | edit source]
Main article: Flower § Usage
Like other flowers, blue orchids can be used as decoration and planted on grass blocks, dirt, coarse dirt, rooted dirt, farmland, podzol, mycelium, moss blocks, mud, or muddy mangrove roots.
Blue orchids can also be placed in flower pots.

Suspicious stew[edit | edit source]
Main article: Suspicious Stew
Using a blue orchid to make suspicious stew, whether by direct crafting or by feeding a brown mooshroom and then milking it with a bowl, imbues it with a Saturation effect that lasts 0.35 seconds in Java Edition and 0.3 seconds in Bedrock Edition. The Saturation effect restores an additional 7 () hunger and 14 saturation in Java Edition, or 6 () hunger and 12 saturation in Bedrock Edition.

Bees[edit | edit source]
Bees engage in a pollinating behavior with blue orchids, increasing the honey level in beehives and bee nests by 1.
Breeding[edit | edit source]
Blue orchids can be used to breed, grow, and lead bees.
Bee nests[edit | edit source]
Oak, birch, and cherry trees grown from saplings that are within 2 blocks of a blue orchid have a 5% chance to grow with a bee nest and 2-3 bees in it.
Composting[edit | edit source]
Placing a blue orchid into a composter has a 65% chance of raising the compost level by 1. A stack of blue orchids yields an average of 5.94 bone meal.

Obtaining[edit | edit source]
Breaking[edit | edit source]
Bookshelves can be mined by hand, but are broken faster with an axe. In either case, they drop 3 books when broken, allowing the reconstruction of the bookshelf with the addition of six wood planks. When broken by a tool enchanted with Silk Touch, a bookshelf drops itself.

Natural generation[edit | edit source]
Bookshelves can generate in village libraries and sometimes village houses.
Strongholds may contain up to two libraries, each of which may be single-level or have an upper balcony. These feature some bookshelves arranged in pillars, and more bookshelves arranged in pillars in the walls. Single-level libraries contain 161 bookshelves, while libraries with balconies contain 233.
Bookshelves also naturally generate in certain woodland mansion rooms. Various rooms can have between 1-24 bookshelves, while the ""large library"" room contains 180.

Main article: Enchantment mechanics § Bookshelf placement
If an enchanting table is placed near a bookshelf, glyph particles fly from the bookshelf toward the enchanting table. Having bookshelves in the proper position near the table allows the table to apply higher-level enchantments.
Fifteen bookshelves need to be near an enchanting table to gain level 30 enchantments.

Obtaining[edit | edit source]
Border blocks can be obtained only by using commands, or using pick block in Creative mode. No tool or explosion can damage them (they act as if they have no collision box when the player tries).
Usage[edit | edit source]
Border blocks are generally used to surround an area to prevent students (or players) and mobs from entering it, or to confine them within the surrounded area. They create an invisible, impassable barrier of infinite height above and below themselves (but not sideways). They prevent players who lack the worldbuilder ability from doing any of the following:
Jumping, climbing, tunneling, or swimming over or under them,
Walking through them,
Building (placing or destroying blocks) over or under them,
Destroying the border block.
Most mobs cannot pass over or under border blocks and cannot target a player or other mob through them. However, they do not stop the ender dragon. Weapons, projectiles, and explosions interact with them as if they were regular walls. Because of this, it is possible to use an ender pearl, chorus fruit, or rideable entity on the other side, to cross one.
Placing or breaking a border block requires the worldbuilder or operator‌[Bedrock Edition only] ability, which can be granted to the player by an operator or host. Border blocks continuously emit red particles.
When used in Bedrock Edition without Education Edition features enabled, border blocks are indestructible, with a height of 1.5 blocks and a width of 1 block.
Piston interactivity[edit | edit source]
Border cannot be pushed by pistons. It also cannot be pushed nor pulled by sticky pistons.

Obtaining[edit | edit source]
Boxes of infinite books can't be crafted. They naturally generate in the ""library"" and ""isolation"" dimensions. They are also available in the creative inventory.
Breaking[edit | edit source]
Boxes of infinite books can be mined by hand, but are broken faster with an axe. In either case, they drop themselves. Unlike bookshelves, they do not require Silk Touch to obtain.

Natural generation[edit | edit source]
Boxes of infinite books naturally generate in the ""library"" dimension where they make up the bulk of the dimension’s terrain, and in the ""isolation"" dimension where 10 boxes can be found in the basement of the house.
Usage[edit | edit source]
When used, if the block is not on one of its chunk's edges and facing along that edge, a random written book is generated. This book can be thrown into a nether portal to create a funky portal.
The random books are tied to the block such that using the same block multiple times always returns an identical book. The title of the random books given by the block is correlated with the location of the block. The title's pattern takes the format <chunk X>/<chunk Z>/<block orientation>/<distance to the chunk's edge to the right of the block>/<block Y>, so books from the same block always has the same title and content.
The author of every book is ""Universe itself"", obfuscated, and every book has 16 pages filled with random text. No books ever drop if game rule doTileDrops is set to false.

Crafting[edit | edit source]
Ingredients Crafting recipe
[hide]
Description
Blaze Rod +
Any stone-tier block

Can use cobblestone and its other variants interchangeably.
Usage[edit | edit source]
Brewing stand GUI in Java Edition
By default, the interface of a brewing stand is labeled ""Brewing Stand"", but this name can be customized by naming it in an anvil before placing it.
Brewing stands cannot be pushed by pistons in Java Edition.
Brewing[edit | edit source]
Main article: Brewing
The main purpose of brewing stands is to allow for the brewing of potions. Their interface can be opened by pressing use on them.
Brewing stands need blaze powder as fuel. Each piece brews 20 batches of potions, with each stage of brewing counting separately. Unlike furnaces, there is no time limit; fuel is consumed only when there are water bottles and an ingredient to brew into it.
Brewing stands interact with hoppers as follows:
They accept brewing ingredients from hoppers pointing down into the top.
Any valid brewing ingredient is pushed into the ingredient slot, regardless of whether it would actually start the brewing process.
Any valid potion recipe can be preloaded for ""hands-free"" brewing of a complex recipe, with the nether wart falling through into the stand for the first step.
Bottles (including empty bottles) and fuel are accepted from hoppers pointing into the side.
Finished products can be pulled out by hoppers below, but each stage of brewing counts as a batch of ""finished"" potions.
In Minecraft Education, elements can be combined in the brewing stand to make the medicine potions: antidote, elixir, eye drops, and tonic.
Profession[edit | edit source]
Main article: Job site block
If a brewing stand has not been claimed by a villager, any nearby unemployed villager has a chance to change their profession to cleric and claim the brewing stand as their job site block.

Trivia[edit | edit source]
Even when the brewing stand is not in use, there is still smoke coming out of the top of it.
In Java Edition, when a brewing stand is broken, particles from a bottle appear, even if no bottle is in the stand.
No matter what potion (including water bottles) is in the stand it always looks like a full red bottle.
Brewing stands always face east, no matter what direction they are placed.
According to Searge, for thematic reasons, a brewing stand was added to the basement of the igloo. Because of this, blaze powder was required for fuel to preserve game progression. In this way, the player is prevented from using it before going to the Nether.[3]

Obtaining[edit | edit source]
Breaking[edit | edit source]
In Java Edition, bubble columns cannot be obtained as an item, and can be placed only by a block-placement command such as /setblock.
In Bedrock Edition, it may be obtained as an item via inventory editing, add-ons, or bugs.
Natural generation[edit | edit source]
Java Edition bubble column. (Click to see the animation)
Whirlpool bubble columns appear naturally when magma blocks generate underwater, in clusters on the floor of aquifers, or as part of ocean ruins and ruined portals generated below the water surface.
Post-generation[edit | edit source]
When a magma block is placed underwater, a whirlpool bubble column is generated.
When soul sand is placed under source water blocks, an upward bubble column is generated.
A bubble column is created 20 game ticks after placing a magma block or soul sand, and is destroyed 5 game ticks after destroying the magma block or soul sand. A bubble column is created or destroyed in all water source blocks of the bubble column simultaneously.
Usage[edit | edit source]
Players and air-breathing mobs can enter a bubble column to replenish their air supply, at the same speed that they would when they leave the water entirely. The slower mining speed when underwater, however, still applies to players inside bubble columns. Water-breathing mobs avoid bubble columns because they suffocate if trapped in one. A bubble column is destroyed when moved by a piston. Bubble columns propagate only through water source blocks, stopping at any flowing water or waterlogged block. The height of a bubble column is limited only by the water's surface or by any obstructing blocks underwater.
Bubble columns cannot be created in downward flowing water.[1] This can be circumvented by placing kelp in downward-flowing water, which converts it into a source block.
Whirlpool[edit | edit source]
A whirlpool, or downward bubble column, is the only type that naturally generates in the Overworld, often originating from magma at the bottom of underwater canyons. A whirlpool can be identified by the presence of air bubbles wandering downward. They drag entities downward. A boat ridden over a whirlpool shakes and eventually sinks if kept above the whirlpool for too long.
Upward[edit | edit source]
Upward bubble columns can be identified by the presence of vertically rising air bubbles. An upward bubble column accelerates entities upward. The longer an object rises through the bubble column, the faster it travels. At high enough speeds, players and entities can be launched out of water by several blocks. Sitting on the surface above a rising bubble column causes entities to bounce upward repeatedly by about 1 block.
Transport[edit | edit source]
In Java Edition, entities move at a speed of approximately 11 blocks per second when in an upward bubble column, or 4.9 blocks per second when in a downward bubble column.
In Bedrock Edition, entities move at a speed of approximately 8 blocks per second when in an upward bubble column, or 6 blocks per second when in a downward bubble column.
Redstone component[edit | edit source]
An observer can detect when a bubble column is created or destroyed in a water source block.
Ender pearl stasis chamber[edit | edit source]
Projectiles such as ender pearls are affected by bubble columns. An ender pearl can remain afloat on top of an upward bubble column, allowing it to be stored indefinitely. A mechanism can then be triggered to make the ender pearl hit a solid surface (e.g. by closing a trapdoor), teleporting the thrower back to the setup wherever they are.

Obtaining[edit | edit source]
Budding amethysts can only be obtained via the Creative inventory or with commands, as they are unobtainable by Survival means, even using a tool enchanted with Silk Touch.
Breaking[edit | edit source]
Budding amethyst cannot be obtained when mined, even using a tool enchanted with Silk Touch. It breaks immediately if pushed by a piston or sticky piston, and cannot be pulled by sticky pistons.

Natural generation[edit | edit source]
Budding amethyst generates naturally as part of amethyst geodes replacing some blocks of amethyst in the innermost layer of the geode.
Usage[edit | edit source]
Growing into amethyst clusters[edit | edit source]
An amethyst bud placed on a budding amethyst (rather than any other block) regardless whether it was placed by the player or spawned by the budding amethyst itself grows over time, going through three growth stages – small, medium, and large – before reaching its 4th and final growth stage as an amethyst cluster, which drops amethyst shards when mined.
In Java Edition, the below logic can be applied:
Per random tick, updates will occur to any given block in the loaded chunk every 68.27 seconds on average if the chunk center is within 128 blocks of a player's location.
Choose one randomly-selected side of the six-sided block. This random choice is done without considering if growth is possible, so if a direction is chosen that cannot grow an amethyst bud, the random tick does not perform any work.
There is a 20% chance to either create a new amethyst bud in air or still water, or to increment the growth stage of an existing amethyst bud, if that bud is attached directly to this block (two adjacent budding amethysts do not speed up growth of a bud between them, as each bud is attached to just one block).
There are 4 growth stages.
As such, the math can be applied if a player is within random tick range as:
(68.27 seconds average for random ticks) x (20% chance of growth for any given single side) x (6 sides) x (4 growth stages) = 68.27×5×6×4 = 8192 seconds average, also 2 hours 16 minutes 32 seconds, also 6.827 in-game days.

May 21, 2009 Notch mentioned crystal blocks as a potential block type that can be found in the underground.
October 3, 2020 Amethyst-related blocks are mentioned at Minecraft Live 2020. It was mentioned that, like with monster spawners, blocks that generate amethysts would not be movable by survival means, forcing players to build farms in situ for these resources.
October 6, 2020 Cory Scheviak tweeted a screenshot where budding amethyst was seen, unnamed at the moment.

JAPPA has said the reasoning for the 'x' pattern on the block is because ""the plane-crystals grow out of it"".[1]
According to Agnes Larsson, budding amethyst cannot be obtained without commands in Survival mode because the developers wanted to encourage players to return to the same amethyst geode repeatedly, rather than mining away the budding amethyst and farming it at their home. This functions in a similar way to the monster spawner.[2]
According to Cory Scheviak, budding amethysts were inspired by atium from the fantasy novel series Mistborn.[3]

A bush is a decorative plant that grows in various grassy biomes in the Overworld. Like grass, bushes will adapt different shades of green based on what biome they are located in. They have no collision, allowing players to walk through them, and if the block directly beneath a bush is broken, the bush will also break.

Natural generation[edit | edit source]
Bushes as they naturally generate.
Small patches of bushes naturally generate in birch forests, old growth birch forests, forests, plains, windswept hills, windswept gravelly hills, windswept forests, and on the shores of rivers and frozen rivers.
Post-generation[edit | edit source]
Using bone meal on a bush attempts to grow another bush on a neighboring block.
Usage[edit | edit source]
Placement[edit | edit source]
Bushes mainly serve as atmospheric decoration and can be placed on coarse dirt, dirt, grass blocks, moss blocks, mud, muddy mangrove roots, mycelium, podzol, rooted dirt and pale moss blocks.
In Bedrock Edition, bushes can be snowlogged-
Composting[edit | edit source]
Placing a bush into a composter has a 30% chance of raising the compost level by 1, yielding an average of 2.74 bone meal per stack.

Natural generation[edit | edit source]
Oak buttons can generate inside trial chambers between dispensers with random surprises or loots. In Java Edition, stone buttons can generate inside strongholds next to iron doors. Jungle buttons generate naturally on house walls in desert villages. Stone buttons can also generate in desert villages, in armorer houses attached to granite.
Usage[edit | edit source]
For more specific usage, see the individual button pages.
Redstone power[edit | edit source]
See also: Redstone circuit
A button can be used as a monostable power source (it automatically deactivates shortly after being activated). A stone button stays on for 1 second (20 ticks, 10 redstone ticks), while a wooden button stays on for 1.5 seconds (30 ticks, 15 redstone ticks).
Placement[edit | edit source]
Buttons can be placed by using it on a surface.
They can be attached to the side, bottom and top of any full opaque block.
Behavior[edit | edit source]
Buttons are usually in an inactive state, but can be temporarily activated by players. A button can be activated by using it.
While active, a button:
powers any adjacent redstone dust to power level 15, including beneath the button (if the button attaches to a vertical surface, or to the bottom of a block)
powers any adjacent redstone comparators or redstone repeaters facing away from the button to power level 15.
strongly powers its attachment block to power level 15.
powers the block of air that it occupies, which in turn is able to power any adjacent redstone components, seemingly sending its power through the air.
activates any adjacent mechanism components, including above or below, such as pistons, redstone lamps, etc.
When a button changes state it provides a redstone update to all redstone components adjacent to itself (including above and below), and to all redstone components adjacent to its attachment block.
Breaking[edit | edit source]
A button is removed and drops as an item if:
its attachment block is moved, removed, or destroyed.
water or lava flows into its space.‌[Java Edition only]
a piston tries to push it or moves a block into its space.

When the spot a cactus is placed in becomes unsuitable, such as when a solid block is placed next to it or its supporting block is removed, the cactus block uproots and drops as an item.
A cactus also removes and drops itself as an item if a piston tries to push it, or moves a block into its space. Trying to pull it with a sticky piston does nothing.
Using a sign on the side of a cactus causes both the sign and the cactus to drop as items.
Natural generation[edit | edit source]
Cactus naturally occur in desert and badlands biomes (twice more common in desert than in badlands). They generate as one (11⁄18 chance), two (5⁄18 chance), or three (2⁄18 chance) blocks tall. Rarely taller cacti can be found if generation chooses to generate another on top of one already generated (although not as commonly as sugar cane).
A potted cactus can also be found in an igloo with a basement. Potted cacti and 3 block cactus can also be found in some desert village buildings.
Cacti also have a chance to generate in the entrance chamber of Trial Chambers.
Mob loot[edit | edit source]
Endermen can pick up cacti. If an enderman is holding a cactus when it dies, the cactus will be dropped.

Trading[edit | edit source]
Wandering traders can sell a cactus for three emeralds.
Usage[edit | edit source]
A cactus block may be placed only on sand, red sand, suspicious sand, or another cactus block. A cactus breaks itself (and drops as an item) if any block with a solid material, or lava, occupies any of the 4 horizontally adjacent blocks. It also breaks if on the sand and the block above is water or lava.
When most entities, including players and mobs, touch a cactus, it deals 1HP damage every tick (although damage immunity reduces this to once every half-second). Damage from touching a cactus is reduced by armor, but touching it also damages the armor. Mobs do not avoid cactus when they pathfind. Notably, armor stands are exempt from this.
A cactus destroys any items that come into contact with it, including other cactus in item form. Falling blocks such as sand and gravel are not destroyed when falling onto cactus; instead, they are transformed into item form (as happens when it falls into any block with a hitbox that has a height less than 1, such as slabs). The item created in this case is sometimes (though not always) destroyed by the cactus. The conversion to an item applies even when the falling block is a cactus (which is possible with /summon).
When a minecart hits a cactus block, the minecart drops as an item and is often destroyed, although a hopper can pick it up faster.
A cactus can also be placed in a flower pot, where it is rendered harmless.
A cactus (excluding its spikes) is 7⁄8 of a block in width (the same as chests) and a full block in height, however the collision box is 15⁄16 of a block high.
Farming[edit | edit source]
Main article: Tutorials/Cactus farming
Cacti naturally grow to a height of three blocks, adding a block of height when the top cactus block has received 16 random ticks (i.e. on average every 18 minutes, but the actual rate can vary widely). Bone meal does not work on cacti to speed their growth.[2][3]A cactus does not need light to grow and is non-flammable. If a cactus has space directly above it, it grows even if the newly-grown block would immediately break due to adjacent blocks.
‌In Java Edition 1.21.5 and Bedrock Edition 1.21.70[upcoming] a cactus also has a chance to grow a cactus flower at any height. This happens after a cactus block has received exactly 9 random ticks (i.e. earlier than growing another cactus block)[verify for Bedrock Edition]. If the cactus is 1 or 2 blocks tall the chance is 10%, at 3 or more blocks tall the chance is 25%. A cactus flower can only grow if there are no blocks in any cardinal directly adjacent to it. A cactus with a cactus flower can no longer grow. When the cactus flower is broken by a player, the cactus may grow taller but can't generate another cactus flower until it has grown at least 1 cactus block.

Player receives 1HP damage when punching them, right clicking on them, or walking on them.
v1.0.11 Cacti can now be placed only on sand, and now have the requirement that the space around it has to be empty. Previously, cacti could be placed to form a damaging floor: both players and mobs would take half a heart of damage when they walk on a cactus block. This made it useful for traps, such as a hallway with a cactus block floor that would kill all mobs that walked on it.
Collecting cacti no longer hurts the player.
The model and texture have been updated to have spines around the block.
v1.0.14 Cactus blocks now can grow to a height of three blocks, allowing for farming. Prior to this update, cacti would not grow.

Trivia[edit | edit source]
Cacti can be placed underwater, provided they are placed on sand, and they grow if they break the surface.
Cacti can be placed next to saplings, but the cactus breaks when the tree grows.
Endermen could move and place cacti. Thus, they can increase the cactus population in deserts by moving cactus blocks as they grow.
Signs can be placed on top of cacti. Paintings can also be placed on the sides of cacti, creating a nasty trap for anyone that tries to go through paintings.
It is possible for cacti to generate on blocks other than sand due to terrain generation; refer to the gallery for examples.
Cactus can be used in the desert to see if the player is in a newly generated area. If most of the cacti around the player is only one block high, then it is most likely new land.
Dying from touching a cactus displays ""[playername] was pricked to death"" in the chat messages.
Blocks can be placed on top of a cactus, including other cactus blocks.
It is possible to place redstone next to a cactus block without destroying it.
A 20 block tall cactus can be found on the seed 43931985876593125 at coordinates (-9711824 , ~ , 7726416) and more recently a 22 block tall one on seed 11343195073417814 at coordinates (14955936 , ~ , -3750655) and even a 23 block tall one on the seed 184693195438010998 and coordinates (16274576 ~ 10230656). All these seeds, found by the Minecraft@home research project, work on Java Edition 1.14.4.[6]
Top snow can be placed next to cacti without breaking the cacti, no matter how many top snow layers stack.

Natural generation[edit | edit source]
Cactus flowers can generate in deserts, badlands, eroded badlands and wooded badlands growing on cactus blocks. Naturally generated cacti have a 25% chance to have a cactus flower on top.
Post generation[edit | edit source]
A cactus flower has a chance of growing on cactus blocks. If a cactus is one or two blocks high the flower has a 10% chance to grow instead of the cactus getting higher. If a cactus is three blocks high the flower has a 25% chance to grow.
Usage[edit | edit source]
Placement[edit | edit source]
Cactus flowers can be placed on cactus blocks or any block which has center support at the top of the block. A placed cactus flower might be used as a decorative block.

Description
Pink Dye Cactus Flower

[upcoming JE 1.21.5 & BE 1.21.70]
Feeding[edit | edit source]
Bees follow players holding a cactus flower in their hand within 6 blocks. Feeding a cactus flower to an adult bee causes it to enter love mode. Two adult bees in love mode will always breed and produce offspring. When fed to a baby bee, it will slightly speed up its growth into an adult bee.
Composting[edit | edit source]
Using cactus flowers on a composter has a 30% chance to raise the compost level by 1. A stack of cactus flowers yields an average of 2.74 bone meal.
Pollination[edit | edit source]
A bee might try to pollinate a cactus flower and collect pollens from it, resulting in the production of either honey or honeycombs at its bee nest. Bees might die this way due to the cactus that often accompanies a cactus flower, which might prick some bees to death during pollination, unless the cactus flower was manually placed by the player on a surface other than cactus.

Obtaining[edit | edit source]
Breaking[edit | edit source]
Once the cake is placed, it cannot be recollected even with the use of Silk Touch, meaning placing it is final (See Tutorials/Things not to do#Wasted resources). Candle cakes always drop their respective candle when broken.

Usage[edit | edit source]

Sunny and Alex eating a cake together.
Unlike most food, the cake cannot be eaten as an item in the hotbar. Before being eaten, it must first be placed on top of a solid block. Placing the cake on a slab also works, as the slab acts like a solid block. The cake instead floats half a block on top of the slab.
Each cake has seven ""slices""; each use consumes one slice progressing inward from the west. A single slice restores 2 () hunger and 0.4 hunger saturation. Eating all seven slices of a cake restores 14 ( × 7) hunger and 2.8 hunger saturation.
Since eating a cake comes with no animation, the cake can be eaten at a rate of one slice per tick. Multiple players can eat from the same cake at the same time. In Java Edition, eating cake makes no sound, unlike other foods.
As a redstone component, when connected to a comparator, a whole cake emits a signal strength of 14. The signal strength decreases two units with each slice.
Cake destroys falling blocks if placed under them, similar to a torch. A player who is sneaking can place any block (including a cake or a falling block) on top of a cake without the block breaking.
Pandas[edit | edit source]
Some pandas move toward a dropped cake to pick up and eat it. Some may not, depending on the cake's location.
Composting[edit | edit source]
Placing a cake into a composter raises the compost level by 1.
Piston interactivity[edit | edit source]
A cake is broken when pushed by a piston, and it drops nothing.
Cakes with candles[edit | edit source]
A cake with candle created by placing a candle on an uneaten cake.
Using a candle on an uneaten cake creates a candle cake of that color (including uncolored). Eating any of the cake causes the candle to drop.
Using flint and steel, fire charge, or any flaming projectile on an unlit candle cake lights its candle. Lit candle cakes emit a light level of 3. Interacting with the lit candle (but not the cake) extinguishes it.

Java Edition Beta
November 23, 2010 Notch stated if Minecraft won the 2010 Indie of the Year Awards, he would add cake to Minecraft.
1.2
Since Minecraft won the title, cake has been added.
Cake heals 18HP × 9.
Cake with six bites taken out of it exists, but is normally inaccessible until release version 1.8, as using a cake with five bites will consume it completely.
1.5 Achievements have been added, including ""The Lie"", which is rewarded when the player crafts a cake.
1.7 The textures for the side and inside of cakes have been shifted vertically due to changes to texture mapping in this version. This does not change how normally-obtainable states of cake look (see #Data history for a case where this change has a visual impact]]), but texture packs from previous versions will no longer be compatible.
1.8 Pre-release Cake now restores 12 ( × 6).
Cake is available in the Creative inventory.

Data history[edit | edit source]
[hide]
Java Edition Beta
1.2


Cakes with seven through fifteen bites also exist, as the number of bites is stored using block metadata which varies from 0 to 15. These have a glitched appearance, with misaligned cake textures as well as the block placeholder texture on the bottom (as the texture next to the bottom of the cake on terrain.png, which it overflows to, is itself a placeholder).
1.7
The cake side texture shown from underneath has flipped to the other side.
1.8 Pre-release
Cakes with data 8 through 15 now use the red mushroom block texture with the addition of the red mushroom block.
[hide]
Java Edition
1.5 13w02a

With the advent of major changes in texture storage and architecture, overeaten cakes now display other parts of cakes as well as part of a crop texture.
From this version up until 14w08a, overeaten cakes start to draw from the textures next to them on blocks-atlas, in much the same way they previously did with terrain.png. However, as texture atlases are unstable and textures tend to change positions as new blocks and textures are added, overeaten cakes change the texture they draw from almost every time new textures are added or existing textures are resized.
13w03a

Overeaten cakes now display a different part of the cake texture than before.
13w09a

Overeaten cakes now display a crop texture on the side.
1.6.1 13w17a

Overeaten cakes now display a part of the powered redstone comparator texture.
13w18a

Overeaten cakes now display the carrots texture. The inside underside also uses the feet of the cauldron.
1.7.2 13w41a

Overeaten cakes now display a part of the block breaking texture, and the texture of the block of diamond inside.
1.8 14w10a Cakes with data values 7 and above now have no model.
1.13 17w47a Prior to The Flattening, this block's numeral ID was 92, and the item's 354.
Issues[edit | edit source]
Issues relating to ""Cake"" are maintained on the bug tracker. Issues should be reported and viewed there.
Trivia[edit | edit source]
Interaction[edit | edit source]
Because cake is only 7⁄8 blocks wide, it is possible to stand on the edge of a block beneath a cake. This makes it possible to create a functioning staircase using cakes placed on a ramp of 1×1 blocks.
It is possible to place cake on top of another cake by placing a cake on the ground, then placing another cake on the side of a block above and to the side of the first cake, similar to placing torches on a chest. Eating the lower cake causes the upper cake to disappear, as does mining out the block of cake it is sitting on.
Mobs on top of cakes rotate while attempting to move, a pathfinding oversight shared with fences.
If cake is placed in a hole one block deep, players can get across the hole without jumping, although a player standing on the cake must jump to get out of the hole.
Miscellaneous[edit | edit source]
The 2010 Indie of the Year Awards logo.
Cake was added to Minecraft following the ModDB 2010 Indie of the Year Awards. Notch agreed to add cake to Minecraft if it won, which led to a campaign called ""The Quest For Cake"". Minecraft won 3 of the 7 awards, including the ""Indie of the Year"" award.
Placing a cake makes the same sound as placing wool.
The player can place cake on top of a bed, and while sleeping, the cake shows on the player's screen as if it were on top of their head.
The name of the achievement for crafting a cake is a reference to the internet meme ""The Cake is a Lie"", which originated from Valve Software's game, Portal.
On May 17, 2019, for the 10th anniversary of Minecraft, the cake model was changed to display a ""10"" above it, made of white concrete.
Unlike most foods, cakes don't count towards the advancement ""A Balanced Diet"" in Java Edition.[2]

Natural generation[edit | edit source]
Calcite generates naturally as part of the structure of amethyst geodes, between the smooth basalt and block of amethyst layers. It also generates in the stony peaks in strips.
Usage[edit | edit source]
Calcite is currently used only for decoration. It has lower blast resistance and hardness than stone-related blocks.

A calibrated sculk sensor is a craftable variant of the sculk sensor. Like its counterpart, it detects vibrations, but it has twice the range and can detect multiple vibrations in quicker succession. It outputs a signal on all sides except for its input, which can receive power to make the sensor listen only to specific vibrations, depending on the input signal strength.

Sculk Sensor

Usage[edit | edit source]
When a calibrated sculk sensor detects a vibration, it is activated and emits redstone signal in every direction (including top and bottom), except the side with the amethyst stripe. The redstone signal emitted from the bottom will strongly power the block below the sensor, where as in all other directions (excluding the side with the amethyst stripe), it is as though the sensor itself is the strongly powered block.
An activated Calibrated Sculk Sensor. Only the block below the sensor is strongly powered. All other sides react as though the sensor itself were strongly powered, excluding the side with the amethyst stripe.

The calibrated sculk sensor is different from the basic sculk sensor in multiple ways:
can detect vibrations within a distance of 16 blocks, instead of 8.
is activated for 10 game ticks after detecting a vibration instead of 30 game ticks
can be filtered (see below) to react only to some sounds.
one side does not emit a redstone signal when activated (the side with the amethyst stripe).
When a calibrated sculk sensor detects a vibration, it is activated for 10 game ticks, then has a 10 game tick cooldown before it can detect another vibration. This means that a calibrated sculk sensor can detect a vibration once per second, as opposed to once every two seconds for a regular sculk sensor.
Filtering[edit | edit source]
When a redstone signal powers a calibrated sculk sensor on its crystalized side, the sensor is filtered to respond only to vibrations that match the strength of that signal. Every vibration in the game has a frequency associated with it, and every vibration frequency directly matches a specific redstone signal strength. For example, a vibration with a frequency of 5 matches the redstone signal with a strength of 5.
Some events can create multiple vibrations simultaneously. For example, eating most food items creates vibrations of frequency 3 (item interaction) and 8 (entity eats). Hitting the ground and taking fall damage creates vibrations of frequency 2 (hit ground) and 7 (entity damage). Using a redstone signal, the sensor can be filtered to detect either frequency. If no redstone signal is provided, the sensor detects the highest frequency.

2 Landing on any solid block (i.e. stone, a slime block, or a honey block) or in any liquid (water, lava, or powder snow).
3 Using an item (casting a fishing pole, throwing a snowball, drinking a potion, drinking milk, etc.).
4 A player gliding with an elytra or a mob performing a unique action (e.g. a ravager roaring, a wolf shaking, etc.).
5 Dismounting a mob or equipping a piece of gear.
6 Mounting a mob or interacting with a mob (e.g. trading with a villager, etc).
7 A mob or player taking damage.
8 Eating a food item.
9 A block 'deactivating' (e.g. closing a door or chest, a pressed button becoming unpressed, etc.).
10 A block 'activating' (e.g. opening a door or chest, a button being pressed, etc.).
11 A block changing (e.g. adding food to campfire, etc.).
12 A non-wool block getting destroyed.
13 A non-wool block getting placed.
14 A mob or player teleporting or spawning.
15 A mob or player dying, or an explosion happening.
Sounds[edit | edit source]
A calibrated sculk sensor is silent if waterlogged. It can still detect vibration, but does not produce sounds itself.

History[edit | edit source]
October 12, 2020 Brandon Pearce mentioned adding ""habituation"" to the sculk sensor.
Java Edition
1.17 20w49a Added unused textures for calibrated sculk sensor to the game files (specifically to the assets/minecraft/textures/blocks directory).
The top texture is a translucent version of the block of amethyst texture, where the side texture is composed of the sculk sensor's side texture overlaid on the amethyst texture.
However, the sculk sensor side texture used is actually the pre-release one shown in Minecraft Live 2020.
The amethyst textures are based on those from 20w45a, despite these textures being added after the amethyst block textures were redone twice, implying these textures come from a scrapped functionality of the sculk sensor coupled with amethyst.
21w13a Removed texture files from the game files.[1]
1.20 23w12a Added calibrated sculk sensors.
23w14a Calibrated sculk sensors now detect vibrations up to 16 blocks radius instead of 8 blocks.
Calibrated sculk sensors now have 1 second active cooldown instead of 2 seconds.
Calibrated sculk sensors now accept signals into the calibration input side more consistently with other redstone components.
Calibrated sculk sensors can now be activated by sniffer digging.
Calibrated sculk sensors can now glow when they trigger, just like a regular sculk sensor.
Default redstone output has been modified to be more reliable for distance calculations.
Calibrated sculk sensors can now strongly power the block they are placed on.
23w16a The model of the calibrated sculk sensor have been changed. The amethyst is now stretched to match the model of the amethyst cluster.
23w17a Now lasts 10 game ticks when in ""Active"" phase instead of 20.
Now lasts 10 game ticks when in ""Cooldown"" phase instead of 1.
23w18a Landing or jumping on the edge of wool no longer triggers calibrated sculk sensors.[2]
Walking on the edge of blocks now properly triggers sculk sensors.[3]
1.20.2 23w31a Calibrated sculk sensors can now detect totems of undying activating.
Calibrated sculk sensors can now detect witches drinking a potion.
Calibrated sculk sensors can now detect turtles clearing away sand.
Calibrated sculk sensors can now detect camels standing up, sitting down, or dashing.
23w32a Vibrations no longer risk being lost on simulation distance limit.
Unequipping items emits a new unequip vibration of frequency 4.
Chiseled bookshelves emit a block_change vibration of frequency 11 when receiving books from hoppers.
Turtle eggs cracking emit a block_change vibration of frequency 11.
Turtle eggs hatching emit a block_destroy vibration of frequency 12.
Using bone meal emits an item_interact_finish vibration of frequency 3.
Fire being doused by water potion emits a block_destroy vibration of frequency 12.
Evokers evoking vexes or fangs emit an entity_place vibration of frequency 14.
Carrots being eaten by rabbits emit a block_change vibration of frequency 11.
Sweet berries being eaten by fox emit a block_change vibration of frequency 11.
Camels eating cactus emit an eat vibration of frequency 8.
1.21 24w19a Frosted ice being placed by Frost Walker emits a block_place vibration of frequency 13.

Obtaining[edit | edit source]
The camera can be obtained in the Creative inventory in Minecraft Education. It can be obtained by either NBT editors, inventory editors, or glitches in Bedrock Edition.
Usage[edit | edit source]
Using a camera from one's inventory captures a first-person screenshot. It may also be placed, creating a camera entity that can track the user, and take pictures from the camera's perspective. Photos that are taken with the camera appear in the portfolio.
Close-up snapshots of an item on the ground can be taken by holding the Shift key while right-clicking.
Screenshots from camera can be inserted into book and quill.[1]
Photos that are taken with the camera block are stored in com.mojang/screenshots.
Behavior[edit | edit source]
Camera in a boat
Cameras are mostly inanimate entities, but they occasionally move when falling and they move at the player's direction when they take a picture.
Cameras are classified as mobs in the game code, they obey gravity, allowing them to fall and having effects common to all other entities. Cameras can be affected by status effects. They can be killed by Harming and Decay splash/lingering potions, and they play the player death sound and fall to their side and disappear, dropping no item. Cameras can't be leashed but they can ride on boats and minecarts.
Camera being harmed by poison effect
Cameras are harmed by fire, lava, and campfire damage but they never die from it. Cameras can be destroyed by any projectile used by the player, such as arrows, tridents, or snowballs. Cameras never drown and are invulnerable to the void, cacti, falling blocks, to explosions or by firework rockets.
Wardens, withers, zoglins, goats, and vindicators named Johnny attack cameras, but the camera remains undamaged; pufferfish also inflate when an camera is nearby. Foxes don't sleep near cameras as well.

Pocket Edition Alpha
v0.1.0 The textures and model of the camera can be found in the game apk file.[2][3]A Java method named saveScreenshot containing codes for saving image to device were found. A Java method named postScreenshotToFacebook was also found but it does not contain any code in it.
v0.2.0 Added cameras.
Changed item and tripod textures.
To use a camera, equip it in the player's hand, then look in the direction the player wants the picture to be taken. Long-press the screen, and a camera drops to the ground where the player are standing. Step back, then press on the camera until it starts emitting smoke particles. The smoke means a picture has been taken, and the camera may disappear immediately afterward.
Cameras have infinite uses.
The Entity ID is 62 and item 456.[4]
v0.4.0 The camera is now invisible and makes the standard player damage sound.
v0.7.0 Added the ""F1"" feature (Hide GUI), which has now made the camera obsolete.
v0.8.0 build 2 Item form now uses egg texture.
v0.9.0 build 1 The camera entity has been removed. Tommaso also stated: ""It doesn't mean that it's dead forever, in fact I have a lot of ideas for it! I think it will be back when have shaders, sharing and redstone.""[5]
v0.14.0 build 1 Re-added the camera, using a new model and item texture. It is accessible only with inventory editors.
If the player spawns a camera, leaves the world and joins back, it summons lightning.
v0.14.2 The camera item ID has been changed to 498, but it cannot be used at the moment. The entity can now be spawned with a spawn egg with a damage value of 62.
According to the language files of the game, the empty label that shows up whenever hovering a finger to a camera would now say ""Take Picture"". However, the button doesn't do anything.
v0.15.0 build 1 The previous empty label on the camera mentioned above now displays the words ""Take Picture"".
The health of the camera entity is now 2HP instead 4HP.
The camera no longer summons lightning.
v0.16.0 build 1 The camera now has a block form in inventory, but still spawns the entity. However, the block can be placed only with commands and editing.
""Take picture"" button on the camera works now, but no image files are created.
The original camera item ID (456) now refers to portfolio.
The changes to the camera were likely accidental due to Bedrock edition sharing the same codebase as Education Edition.
build 2 The camera now has an item form and the block has been removed. However, it is still obtainable in servers.
Portfolio, which works together with the camera to create collections of pictures, has been removed.
build 4 Camera item form has been removed, and the camera can no longer be obtained or placed using any command.

Future[edit | edit source]
At the Minecraft Pocket Edition panel at MINECON 2012, as well as one of Jbernhardsson's livestreams, it was stated that future plans include trying to have a proper use for cameras, perhaps an easier way to take screenshots and share them with others.[6] In the BlockTalk Q&A, the camera was briefly mentioned as part of a broader ""sharing"" theme planned for Bedrock Edition in the future.[7] It later got implemented into Minecraft Education, using the camera to make screenshots and share them in a special book.
Issues[edit | edit source]
Issues relating to ""Camera"" are maintained on the bug tracker. Issues should be reported and viewed there.
Trivia[edit | edit source]
A camera prevents a book and quill from working. Attempting to craft it or obtain it by commands gives a regular book instead, due to non-implementation of photo attaching to written books.[verify]
The camera can take a screenshot, which appears a bit smaller with a thick paper outline having cuts on its edges, making it look like an old photograph.
This feature is hidden from the Creative inventory and from the /give command item menu.

Obtaining[edit | edit source]
Breaking[edit | edit source]
Campfires can be mined with any tool or by hand, but axes are the fastest. A regular campfire drops 2 charcoal. If mined with a tool enchanted with Silk Touch, the campfire instead drops itself as an item.
In Bedrock Edition, a campfire can also be broken by pushing it with a piston or sticky piston. Pistons cannot move or break campfires in Java Edition.

Natural generation[edit | edit source]
Campfires can generate in taiga and snowy taiga‌[Bedrock Edition only] villages.
Campfires can generate in camps inside ancient cities, beneath a pile of blue, light blue and cyan wool blocks. Campfires can also generate in trail ruins.

Usage[edit | edit source]
Lit campfires emit a light level of 15. Unlike regular fire, a campfire's fire does not spread under any circumstances.
Campfires are lit by default when placed. A campfire can be manually lit by using flint and steel on it (either by player or by dispenser), using a fire charge on it, shooting it with a flaming arrow, or using or dispensing fire charges, blaze fireballs, and ghast fireballs when /gamerule mobGriefing is true. In Bedrock Edition, campfires can also be lit by using an item enchanted with Fire Aspect, or stepping on it while burning.
A campfire can be extinguished by waterlogging it (placing water in the same block space), throwing a splash water bottle on it, or using a shovel on it. Campfires cannot be extinguished from their bottom face.‌[JE only][1] In Bedrock Edition, campfires can also be extinguished by placing a water source or allowing water to flow in the space above the campfire. As with torches, rain does not extinguish campfires.[2]
Using flint and steel on the side of a waterlogged or lit campfire sets the adjacent air block on fire instead.
Particles and smoke signals[edit | edit source]
A campfire emitting smoke
Campfires produce smoke particles that float up around 10 blocks before disappearing. If a hay bale is placed below, the campfire becomes a signal fire and the smoke floats up 24 blocks instead.
Campfire smoke particles can partially pass through a block directly above it, but do not pass through blocks any higher than that.
Although a trapdoor is thinner than a slab, a trapdoor can block the smoke completely, preventing the smoke from floating up.
Campfires emit extra smoke particles during rain, similar to lava.
Campfires also occasionally emit ember particles, similar to lava.
Damage[edit | edit source]
If lit, campfires damage mobs standing on top of them, even if underwater (with exceptions such as shulkers, zombified piglins, or guardians). Campfires deal 1HP every tick (although damage immunity reduces this to once every half-second). Campfires do not cause lasting burning or destroy items. Damage taken is not considered fire damage, so armor itself does not reduce damage caused by campfire; to do so, the player need the Resistance potion effects, or the Protection and Fire Protection enchantments. The player can avoid being damaged at all, either by using a potion of Fire Resistance or wearing Frost Walker boots.
Regardless of height, all blocks prevent damage done to mobs or players above campfires. The campfire deals damage only to entities occupying its block.
Cooking[edit | edit source]
Some food being cooked on a campfire
The player can place any of the following food items on a lit campfire by using the food item on it.
Raw Beef
Raw Chicken
Raw Rabbit
Raw Porkchop
Raw Mutton
Raw Cod
Raw Salmon
Potato
Kelp
Up to four food items can be placed on a campfire, which cooks the items simultaneously. Unlike other blocks that can cook food, campfires do not require any kind of fuel to cook. On a campfire, foods produce small smoke particles, indicating they are being cooked. Food items take 30 seconds (600 ticks) to cook, compared to 10 seconds for furnaces or 5 seconds for smokers. Assuming that one uses all four slots to cook at once, campfires are more efficient than furnaces (taking 10 seconds less per four items and no fuel) for cooking, but must be watched so as to pick up the food and refill it once it is done. It is slower than a smoker by about ten seconds, but its lack of fuel consumption could be seen as a worthwhile trade-off. Once finished cooking, items pop off the campfire. If the campfire is extinguished while cooking food, the remaining cooking time quickly counts back up. Food items can be placed on an unlit campfire. Any items cooking on a campfire always drop when the campfire block is broken.
Other items can be placed on campfires using external editors, mods, or add-ons.
Hoppers[edit | edit source]
Campfires do not have an external inventory. Raw food cannot be loaded into the campfire with a hopper.
A hopper placed directly underneath a campfire pulls through any items dropped into the campfire. Any drops from a mob that dies in the campfire get pulled into the hopper.
Bees[edit | edit source]
Placing a campfire under a beehive or bee nest allows honey bottles and honeycomb to be harvested without provoking the bees.
There must be unobstructed air between the campfire and the beehive or bee nest. Carpets are an exception.‌[Java Edition only]
Light source[edit | edit source]
Standard lit campfires emit a light level of 15. Like most other sources of light, campfires melt nearby snow and ice.
Note blocks[edit | edit source]
Campfires can be placed under note blocks to produce ""bass"" sounds.
Piston interactivity[edit | edit source]
In Bedrock Edition, pushing a campfire with a piston or sticky piston breaks it. Campfires cannot be pulled by sticky pistons.
In Java Edition, pistons do not interact with campfires. Campfires neither move nor break when pushed or pulled by pistons.

A candle is a block that emits light when lit with a flint and steel. It comes in the sixteen dye colors. Up to four of the same color of candle can be placed in one block space, which affects the amount of light produced.
Dyed candles are the dyed variants of candles, that once dyed, cannot be changed into a different color.

Usage[edit | edit source]
Light[edit | edit source]
All candles can be used as a light source, emitting light like a sea pickle. A single candle emits a light level of 3. Up to four identically colored candles may be placed in one block, with each candle increasing the emitted light level by 3, for a maximum light level of 12. They also emit fire particles.

4 12
Candles are not lit when they are placed, and must be lit using flint and steel, fire charge, or any flaming projectile. If any candle is already lit, more candle(s) that may be added (if possible) are also lit. In Bedrock Edition, a mob/player that is burning, a Fire Aspect book or any sword enchanted with Fire Aspect can also be used to light candles. Any candle may be waterlogged, but waterlogged candles cannot be lit. Lit candles can be extinguished using water (even a water bottle‌[Java Edition only]), wind charges, or by the player interacting with the candle.
Cakes[edit | edit source]
A single candle of any color may be used on an uneaten cake, turning it into a candle cake, which acts as a normal, singular candle on top of a cake. If the candle cake is eaten at all or destroyed, the candle is dropped. Interacting with the lit candle (but not the cake) extinguishes it. Interacting with a lit candle cake causes the player to eat it if possible, but if the held item is a flint and steel or fire charge, the appropriate block becomes lit, if possible (otherwise nothing happens).

↑ The list of possible offers contains individual offers for each color, so multiple colors may be offered by the same villager as separate trades.
Usage[edit | edit source]
Carpet has the same visual thickness as a pressure plate. It has a hitbox of 1⁄16 of a block and covers the entire surface of the block it is placed on. This thickness prevents mob spawning.
Carpet can be placed on any block, including non-solid blocks, except air and item frame‌[Java Edition only]. When placed on grass or fern, they break and the carpet is placed on the block below. When placed on vines, the topmost block of vines breaks and the carpet is placed on the block below, any vines blocks below the first one don't break. It can even be placed over water blocks, but to do so you must target an adjacent block with a visible hitbox.
Carpet can be pushed and pulled by pistons but pops off if pushed onto a hole or pulled downward. It can also break falling sand and gravel.
Carpet is an opaque block but does not decrease light going through it. Because of this and the fact that it can be placed on any block, a common decorative strategy is to place carpet on a light-emitting block in the floor, illuminating a room and hiding the light source at the same time.
Carpets can be placed on top of fences and walls to allow the player to jump on top of them while still preventing animals and mobs from crossing. This is because mobs do not try jump over fences and walls, even with a carpet above.
In Java Edition, if a campfire is placed beneath a beehive to pacify bees, the campfire can be placed below ground and a carpet placed over the campfire to protect bees from the fire. In Bedrock Edition, a carpet over a campfire removes the campfire's pacifying effect on bees.
If a carpet is placed so that it lays on top of a hopper, the hopper can still collect items through the carpet. This is because hoppers can collect items from less than a full block above in Java Edition, or less than 3⁄4 of a block above in Bedrock Edition.
Carpets can also be placed over other carpets. Mobs are unable to walk over two or more layers of carpets, because the mob's AI treats carpets as if they are air blocks. If a mob stands on a double carpet layer, it stays perfectly still.‌[Java Edition only] Similarly, endermen are unable to teleport onto double carpet layers.
Carpets, similar to wool, dampens vibrations from sculk sensors. These include placing, breaking, and entities walking/jumping on. However, unlike wool, carpets dampen only horizontal vibration paths.
Decorating llamas[edit | edit source]
All llama carpet patterns.
Llamas can be equipped with carpets in their carpet slot (). Each carpet color shows as a different patterned rug on the llama's back.
Enchanting[edit | edit source]
Carpets cannot be enchanted in survival mode. However, in Java Edition creative mode, just like any other item, it can be enchanted with any enchantment using an anvil. While most enchantments have no effect, Thorns, Protection, Fire Protection, Blast Protection, Curse of Binding and Curse of Vanishing apply their effects to the llama as expected.
Fuel[edit | edit source]
Carpet can be used as a fuel in furnaces, smelting 0.335 items per carpet item.‌[Java Edition only]
Breaking tall grass and vines[edit | edit source]
When placed on the top half of blocks like tall grass, large fern, or vines they break and the carpet drops as an item.

Obtaining[edit | edit source]
Breaking[edit | edit source]
See also: Fortune § Seeds
Fully grown carrot crops drop 2 to 5 carrots (3 5⁄7 per crop harvested on average). Yield can be increased using a tool enchanted with Fortune, with Fortune III harvesting an average of 5 3⁄7 carrots.
The yield is calculated by a binomial distribution: 2 drops are fixed, then a drop is attempted three times with a success rate of 57.14286% to yield the extra 0–3 drops. Each level of Fortune enchantment increases the number of attempts by one.

Axes are considered the preferred tool,[1] and swords would also increase the breaking speed,[2] however these ultimately have no impact due to the instant default mining speed.
Natural generation[edit | edit source]
Village farm plots have a chance of having carrots. The exact chance depends on the style of the village:
Village style Chance
Plains 30%
Snowy 10%
Mob loot[edit | edit source]
Zombies, husks, and zombie villagers have a 2.5% (1⁄40) chance of dropping either an iron ingot, carrot, or potato when killed by a player or tamed wolf. This is increased by 1% (1⁄100) per level of looting. This gives carrots the following chances of dropping:
1⁄120 (about 0.83%)
7⁄600 (about 1.17%) with Looting I
9⁄600 (about 1.50%) with Looting II

See also: Hunger management
To eat a carrot, press and hold use while the carrot is selected in the hotbar. Eating a carrot restores 3 () hunger and 3.6 hunger saturation.
Farming[edit | edit source]
See also: Crop farming
Carrots can be farmed and harvested on farmland. Planted carrots go through 8 stages of growth, but only 4 apparent stages because the texture only changes upon reaching stages 1, 3, 5, and 8 with stage 8 being the final, mature appearance.
Carrots require a light level of 8 or greater to plant‌[Java Edition only] and 9 or greater to grow. In Bedrock Edition they can be planted at any light level, but need an internal light level of 9 to grow. Crops grow faster if the farmland they are planted in is hydrated. Using bone meal on crops also increases the speed of growth by randomly increasing their growth stage by 2 to 5.
Crops break if pushed by a piston or if their supporting farmland breaks or turns to dirt (e.g. by being trampled), dropping their usual drops.
If /gamerule mobGriefing is true, rabbits find mature carrot crops‌[Java Edition only] / carrot crops with growth stage greater than 1‌[Bedrock Edition only]. This reduces the growth stages by one, removing the crop completely when the growth stage reaches 0.
Breeding[edit | edit source]
Carrots can also be used to breed and attract pigs and rabbits.
Villagers can pick up carrot items to become willing, which allow them to breed. Villagers require 12 carrots to become willing.

Usage[edit | edit source]
Placement[edit | edit source]
Regardless of the player's position during placement, the different textures of the block are always facing the same direction (the texture with the globe in the right corner always faces west, while the one with the compass and map faces up).
Zooming out, cloning, locking maps[edit | edit source]
The GUI of cartography table in Java Edition.
The GUI of cartography table in Bedrock Edition.
Cartography tables are used for zooming out, cloning, and locking maps (making them unable to be altered). They can also be used for adding pointers to maps, creating empty maps, and renaming maps.‌[Bedrock Edition only]
Below is a list of brief descriptions of all available functions of the cartography table:
For more detailed information of each of these functions, see Map § Usage.
First slot Second slot Result
Map Paper Zoomed out map (1 zoom level higher)
Map Empty map Two identical maps
Map Glass Pane Locked map
Map Compass Locator map‌[Bedrock Edition only]
Empty map Compass Empty Locator map‌[Bedrock Edition only]
Paper Empty map‌[Bedrock Edition only]
Paper Compass Empty Locator map‌[Bedrock Edition only]
Zooming out a map always starts with an existing map, not a blank map. Zooming it out makes the map aligned to the grid that would include the area of the original map. To build a set of maps such as for a map wall, a player cannot create several level 0 (base) maps at one location then zoom them out before going out into the world to fill them in; the player must start with a base map created in each area to be covered by the zoomed out map. See more discussion of map alignment at Map.
Profession[edit | edit source]
Main article: Job site block
If a cartography table has not been claimed by a villager, any nearby unemployed villager has a chance to change their profession to cartographer and claim the cartography table as their job site block.
Fuel[edit | edit source]
A cartography table can be used as a fuel in furnaces, smelting 1.5 items per block.
Note blocks[edit | edit source]
Cartography tables can be placed under note blocks to produce ""bass"" sounds.

When a carved pumpkin is pushed by a piston, it breaks and drops as an item. It cannot be pulled.
Natural generation[edit | edit source]
Carved pumpkins generate in rail rooms in woodland mansions, as well as in pillager outposts as a part of scarecrows.
Mob loot[edit | edit source]
The carved pumpkin of a snow golem can be obtained by shearing its head, revealing the golem's face. The carved pumpkin cannot be put back on the golem.
Post-generation[edit | edit source]
A carved pumpkin (and 4 pumpkin seeds in Java Edition or 1 unit of pumpkin seeds in Bedrock Edition) is obtained by using shears on an uncarved pumpkin. Once carved, a pumpkin cannot be changed back to uncarved. This changes the rotation of the top texture.‌[Java Edition only][1]
Usage[edit | edit source]
When placed, a carved pumpkin automatically faces the player. However, in Java Edition the stems are directional, meaning the stem will point towards the face, while in Bedrock Edition the stems are non-directional, meaning the stems always face northwest just like normal pumpkins.
Crafting ingredient[edit | edit source]

Crafting recipe
Jack o'Lantern Carved Pumpkin +
Torch

Helmet[edit | edit source]
A carved pumpkin can be equipped as a helmet without any actual armor value. When worn, it limits the player's viewing area to a mask pattern that resembles the pumpkin's carved face. The pattern does not appear when using the third-person view (toggled by F5 by default). In Java Edition, it also doesn't appear when the heads-up display is disabled by pressing F1.[2]
A player wearing a carved pumpkin does not aggravate endermen or freeze creakings when looking at them. Wearing a carved pumpkin makes the player invisible to other players on a locator map.
Dispensers[edit | edit source]
Dispensers can equip a carved pumpkin on a player, mob or armor stand with an empty helmet slot, within the block the dispenser is facing. It can also place the carved pumpkin as a block, if a snow or iron golem can be spawned after the pumpkin is placed.
Building golems[edit | edit source]
Snow golem
Iron golem
Carved pumpkins can be used to make snow golems and iron golems as shown below. Snow golems require snow blocks for their bodies, while iron golems require iron blocks. The carved pumpkin must be placed last or the golem does not spawn. The orientation of the carved pumpkin does not matter while building an iron golem or snow golem.

Enchantments[edit | edit source]
Carved pumpkins can receive the following enchantments, but only through an anvil.

Composting[edit | edit source]
Placing a carved pumpkin into a composter has a 65% chance of raising the compost level by 1.

Trivia[edit | edit source]
The carved pumpkin is the only headgear that obstructs the player's view.
The function of using the carved pumpkin as a headgear might be a reference to the web-comic ""Jailbreak"" where one of the main characters carved a pumpkin that got stuck on his head to see.
A carved pumpkin enchanted with Curse of Binding cannot be removed from a player's helmet slot unless the player dies, since it does not lose durability like armor does.
In Hardcore mode, such a carved pumpkin effectively stays on the player forever.

Natural generation[edit | edit source]
A naturally occurring cauldron inside of a witch hut. Notice the incorrect cat skin.
A single empty cauldron is generated in each swamp hut. In Bedrock Edition, the cauldrons generated there are 1⁄3 to 2⁄3 full of a random potion.
A cauldron 2⁄3 full of water is generated in each igloo basement.
Cauldron in woodland mansion jail.
Cauldrons can be found in a few rooms inside of woodland mansions.
Two filled cauldrons can be found inside savanna, taiga, snowy taiga, and snowy tundra village tannery houses.
A single filled cauldron can be found in plains village and desert village tannery houses.
In Java Edition, three filled cauldrons can be found in plains village tannery houses.
Cauldrons can also generate in trail ruins.
Crafting[edit | edit source]
A cauldron can be crafted from iron ingots.

Usage[edit | edit source]
Storage for substances[edit | edit source]
Cauldrons can hold a variety of substances. Fluids they cannot hold include milk, honey and any food items that exist in bowls; namely mushroom stew, beetroot soup, rabbit stew and suspicious stew. In Java Edition, cauldrons containing fluids are considered by the game to be separate blocks from each other and from empty cauldrons, which does not affect gameplay but does affect the commands needed to place them.
Holding water[edit | edit source]
A cauldron can be filled with water by using a water bucket on the cauldron. Once completely filled, a cauldron can be used to fill a water bucket by using an empty bucket on the cauldron; this empties the cauldron. Despite containing water, using a fish bucket on a cauldron does not fill it with water, but places water against it, meaning it does nothing to the cauldron.[1]
A cauldron can also be filled by dumping a water bucket on the block above the cauldron. Once the water block is removed, the cauldron is filled to the full level with water.‌[Bedrock Edition only]
In Java Edition, a cauldron can contain three levels of water. One level of water can be added to a cauldron by using a water bottle on it. One level of water can be removed from a cauldron, filling a water bottle, by using a glass bottle on it.
In Bedrock Edition, a cauldron can contain six levels of water, and using a water bottle or a bottle on a cauldron respectively adds or removes two levels from it. If there are less than two levels remaining, a bottle cannot be used to retrieve the remaining water, and it must be either replaced or removed through a method that reduces the level by one.
A cauldron slowly fills with water when rained upon, if starting empty or with some water. This happens randomly, at 5% of the rate in which snow accumulates on the ground during snowfall.
Water can be stored in a cauldron, even in the Nether. Water in a cauldron does not freeze in cold biomes.
Water in a cauldron does not absorb explosion damage; make sounds and particles; absorb fall damage;[2][3] allow tridents enchanted with Riptide to activate;[4][5] or damage endermen‌[JE only], striders, or blazes.[6][7] Cauldrons do not deal drowning damage to mobs inside of them[8] and fish act as if there is no water inside it.[9] The player cannot float or swim in it, as the water is about level with the player's waist. Jumping in a cauldron does not produce any bubble or water particles.
A cauldron placed below a down-facing pointed dripstone that has water placed a block above it slowly fills with water. The same works with lava, allowing for infinite lava generation. The pointed dripstone must be within 10 blocks above the cauldron.
Attempting to add lava or potion to water empties the cauldron.‌[Bedrock Edition only]
The water in a cauldron cannot be sucked up by a sponge, whether the sponge is touching the cauldron or not.[10]
Applying dye to cauldron water[edit | edit source]
This feature is exclusive to Bedrock Edition. 
In Bedrock Edition, a cauldron can hold dyed water. Using a dye on a cauldron filled with water colors the water, consuming the dye. Different dyes may be added to produce mixed colors. Using any piece of leather armor, leather horse armor, or wolf armor on the cauldron dyes that item the color of the water, reducing the water in the cauldron by one level for each item dyed.
Attempting to add water, lava, powder snow, or potions to dyed water empties the cauldron.
Holding lava[edit | edit source]
Cauldron filled with lava
Cauldrons can be used to hold lava. In Bedrock Edition and Minecraft Education, when a cauldron is already filled with water, it empties the cauldron and makes an extinguishing sound. A cauldron filled with lava emits a light level of 15, similar to lava, and burns any entity inside of it; in Bedrock Edition and Minecraft Education, this includes mobs that do not take damage from lava like zombified piglins.
Lava inside a cauldron does not interact with water outside of the cauldron. The lava disappears upon putting water in the cauldron.
A redstone comparator with a lava cauldron behind it outputs redstone signal strength of 3.[11][12]
A cauldron placed below a down-facing pointed dripstone that has lava placed a block above it slowly fills with lava.
If a cauldron is filled by lava, using glass bottles on the cauldron does nothing.
Holding powder snow[edit | edit source]
Powder snow is currently the only solid material that can be stored in a cauldron. A cauldron slowly fills with powder snow during snowfall, if starting empty or with any layer of powder snow already inside. Up to three‌[JE only] or six‌[BE only] layers can be filled. When the cauldron is full, interacting using a bucket, creates a powder snow bucket and empties the cauldron. Entities standing in the cauldron do not take freeze damage, and entities wearing leather boots still fall through the powder snow.
A redstone comparator with a powder snow cauldron behind it outputs a redstone signal strength proportional to the fill level, up to 3.
Contrary to a cauldron filled with water, a powder snow cauldron that is not full cannot be filled up with a powder snow bucket, as using the bucket on the cauldron instead places powder snow against it.
Holding potions[edit | edit source]
This feature is exclusive to Bedrock Edition and Minecraft Education. 
In Bedrock Edition, a cauldron can hold normal potions, splash potions and lingering potions. Using a potion on a cauldron empties the potion and increases the level of the potion in the cauldron by two levels. A glass bottle can then be used on a cauldron with a potion in it, filling the bottle with that potion. This reduces the potion in the cauldron by two levels. If there is only one level of potion remaining, it cannot be retrieved using a bottle and must be either replaced or used to tip an arrow.
Using an arrow on a cauldron that contains a potion transforms the arrow into a tipped arrow with that potion effect, and reduces the potion in the cauldron by one level. Tipping multiple arrows at once can be more efficient, and it may use more than one level at once. 1 level of potion tips up to 16 arrows, 2 levels up to 32, 3 levels up to 48, and 4 levels up to a full stack of arrows, resulting in 21.33 tipped arrows per potion. The bottom three levels of a cauldron are only counted as a single level for the purposes of tipping arrows, therefore any quantity of arrows that would leave less than three levels of potion remaining when tipped empties the cauldron completely.
Attempting to put water, lava or a different potion into a cauldron with a potion causes an explosion sound, and the cauldron is emptied.
An entity that stands in a cauldron filled to any level with any potion does not receive the effect of the potion.
Using an empty bucket on a cauldron filled with any potion does nothing, as the bucket remains empty and the potion in the cauldron does not empty.
Removing dye from items[edit | edit source]
A cauldron with water can wash the dye off of leather armor, leather horse armor, wolf armor, and shulker boxes, and can remove the top-most pattern layer of a banner. This is done by pressing use on the cauldron with the leather armor, wolf armor, shulker box, or banner in hand. Each wash reduces the water in the cauldron by one level. The water does not become dyed while removing dye from objects.
Profession[edit | edit source]
Main article: Job site block
If a cauldron has not been claimed by a villager, any nearby unemployed villager has a chance to change their profession to leatherworker and claim the cauldron as their job site block.
Extinguishing fire[edit | edit source]
A cauldron with water or powder snow extinguishes entities on fire that fall into it and the entity emits black particles. This includes mobs, players, items (if they land in the cauldron before burning up), and flaming arrows‌[JE only]. Flaming arrows stuck into the side are also extinguished. Entities must reach the water or powder snow in it. Each entity extinguished causes the substance in the cauldron to decrease by one level. If the cauldron is filled with powder snow, it then becomes a water cauldron.
Redstone component[edit | edit source]
An example of a cauldron used in a redstone circuit.
See also: Redstone circuit
A cauldron can act as a power source for a redstone comparator. With a cauldron behind it (either directly, or separated by an unpowered solid block), a comparator outputs a signal strength proportional to how full the cauldron is: 0 for empty, 1 for one-third full, 2 for two-thirds full, and 3 for completely full or filled with lava. However, if there is a block between the cauldron and the comparator, the comparator does not immediately update.

Java Edition
1.0.0 Beta 1.9 Prerelease 2 Cauldrons are present in the code, but are not assigned to a block ID (and thus are unobtainable without mods (archived link: [1])).
Beta 1.9 Prerelease 3 Cauldrons have been given a block ID, an item ID, and a crafting recipe.
1.2.1 12w06a Cauldrons have now become renewable, due to zombies sometimes dropping iron ingots.
1.4.2 12w40a Empty cauldrons can now be found in witch huts.
1.5 13w02a The walls inside of the cauldron now use the bottom texture, and the cauldron now has no bottom.[14]
13w02b Fixed the model error from 13w02a.
1.8 14w03a Cauldrons now appear completely opaque.[15]
14w03b Cauldrons now render as normal again.

Reason: Many potion cauldrons here are listed as being added in versions where said potion did not exist yet - please rearrange and add new history entries accordingly
This section would benefit from the addition of more images. 
Please remove this notice once you've added suitable images to the article.
The specific instructions are: Possible/potential need? Add Night Vision cauldron potion BE2, and also the new potion colors for cauldrons as of 1.20+.
[hide]
Java Edition
1.0.0 Beta 1.9 Prerelease 2
Cauldrons are intended to be used for the creation of potions.
Cauldrons can be made to work with a mod, through which the following has been revealed:
Applying a potion ingredient to a water cauldron cause it to change to a differently-colored lava texture, and adding any further potion ingredients to the filled cauldron cause the liquid to change color.
Scooping out a potion with ingredients applied cause the potion to have an effect related to the ingredient, e.g. a potion brewed with a magma cream have Fire Resistance as an effect.
Beta 1.9 Prerelease 3 The system was deemed too complex and not user-friendly,[23] so the cauldron's ability to brew potions has been replaced with the brewing stand.[24][25] That brewing system is finalized and doesn't change in the rest of the pre-releases.

Natural generation[edit | edit source]
Chains can generate in treasure room bastion remnants and sometimes in ruined portals that generate in the Nether. They always generate above magma cube spawners, also found in treasure room bastions.
Chains can also generate in mineshafts. They generate on the sides of a wooden bridge (a mid-air corridor) when the distance between the bridge and the highest solid block below it is higher than the distance to the lowest solid block above it. Chains here generate vertically in a pillar between the bridge and the ceiling. The lowest block of the pillar, connecting the chain to the bridge, is always an oak fence.
In addition, chains can also generate in trial chambers making up various hanging platforms in certain rooms.

Usage[edit | edit source]
Chains can be used to suspend bells, hanging signs, lanterns, and soul lanterns, as the chain texture connects to the chain of the lantern seamlessly as if it were part of it, and it connects the hanging sign chains together. Chains do not require a supporting block to be placed whether it is on the top, next to it or at the bottom. It can exist completely free-standing in mid air[1] and it can be rotated. Chains connect horizontally or vertically, but not across different orientations (so a chain with N orientation does not connect to a chain with E orientation in the adjacent block). Horizontal chains one block above a surface may be walked over. Horizontal chains two blocks above a surface prevent players from traveling past them. Vertical chains block travel if targeted directly, but may be skirted.
Precision is required, but chains can be walked on, allowing for inconspicuous, although somewhat costly, bridges.
Chains can be pushed by pistons without being broken.
In Bedrock Edition, chains are not conductive, but the comparator can work in being separated from the measured block by a chain.

Obtaining[edit | edit source]
In Minecraft Education, chalkboards can be obtained in the Creative inventory or through the /give command. In Bedrock Edition, chalkboards cannot be obtained by commands or the Creative inventory, and can only be obtained by using glitches or inventory editors.
Usage[edit | edit source]
A chalkboard can be used similarly to a sign, to display text. Once placed, select the chalkboard and enter the desired text and click the ""OK"" button. The ""×"" in the upper right corner of the board closes the edit screen.
Placement[edit | edit source]
Chalkboards may be placed on the top or side of other blocks (including non-solid blocks like fences, glass, rails, and other chalkboards). To place a chalkboard, use a chalkboard item while pointing at the block the chalkboard should be attached to. To place a chalkboard on a block that can be interacted with by the use control (for example, chests, note blocks, etc.), sneak while placing the chalkboard.
1×1 slates placed on the top of a block stand on a short post, facing in the direction of the player who placed it, in any of 16 different directions. 2×1 posters and 2×3 boards can be placed in any of 4 different directions. Chalkboards placed on the side of a block simply float there, even if the block doesn't make contact with the chalkboards.
Text[edit | edit source]
When entering text, six lines of text are available for the slates and posters, while fifteen lines of text are available for the 2×3 boards. To switch between lines, the player can press Enter or the up/down arrow keys. The location of text currently selected has a flashing cursor.
While editing, typing and backspacing can occur at any point in the line by moving the cursor using the left and right arrow keys. Once the end of the line has been reached, the word is hyphenated and is continued on the next line.
After the editing window is closed, right-clicking on a chalkboard reopens the editing menu. Copy and paste can be performed, and no more than the basic/shifted keyboard characters may be entered.
Interaction[edit | edit source]
Chalkboards act as though they have a use action, so sneaking is required to place blocks or use items while the cursor is pointed at them.
Unlike signs, boards block a piston from moving.
Boards have no collision box (they are completely non-solid), so items and mobs can move through boards blocks. Other blocks (including other boards) can be placed on any edge of a board.
Water and lava flow around boards. Lava can create fire in air blocks next to boards as if the boards were flammable, but the boards do not burn.

History[edit | edit source]
[hide]
Pocket Edition Alpha
v0.16.0 build 1
Added chalkboards.
Chalkboards can be obtained and placed using the /give and /setblock commands respectively. However, they serve no purpose.
Their addition was likely accidental due to Bedrock edition sharing the same codebase as Education Edition.
build 2 Removed chalkboards. Their textures still exist in the files.
[hide]
Bedrock Edition
1.11.0 beta 1.11.0.1 Re-added chalkboards. They still exist as entities, but can't be spawned. The items can't be spawned either.
1.17.30 beta 1.17.30.20 Chalkboards can now be placed consistently.
1.21.50 Preview 1.21.50.25 Slates have been added to the Creative inventory, likely by accident.[2]
Chalkboard models are now masked by placeholder block models, even in worlds with the Education edition toggle on.[3]
Preview 1.21.50.28 Slates have been removed from the Creative inventory.
1.21.60 Preview 1.21.60.21 Chalkboard models are no longer masked by placeholder block models.
[hide]
Minecraft Education
MinecraftEdu MinecraftEdu, Education Edition's predecessor, had ""Big Signs"", 3 block wide signs that served a similar purpose.
1.0
Added chalkboards.
1.0.2 The UI of chalkboards now has a locked option.
Students now can place their own chalkboards even without a worldbuilder ability.

Charred baked potato bricks take a very long time to mine due to their extremely high hardness. Even using a golden hoe with Efficiency V and a Haste II effect, mining them still takes almost 30 seconds. However, unlike other blocks with high hardness (e.g. trial spawners, reinforced deepslate), charred baked potato bricks drop as an item when mined.

Mob loot[edit | edit source]
Upon death, moon cows drop 0-2 cheese. The maximum amount is increased by 1 per level of Looting, for a maximum of 5 cheese blocks with Looting III.
Milk bucket[edit | edit source]
If the minecraft:instacheese vote is active, using a milk bucket on the ground places cheese, similarly to powder snow. It cannot be picked up into the bucket again.
Usage[edit | edit source]
Similar to cakes, cheese can be eaten when placed in the world. However, unlike cakes, the cheese block is divided into 8 smaller cubes. Clicking on one of them eats only the selected part, unlike cakes, where slices cannot be chosen.
Eating cheese restores both hunger and oxygen, allowing the player to survive on the Moon.

Breaking[edit | edit source]
A chest can be broken using anything, but an axe is the fastest. Chests always drop themselves when mined. If the chest contains items, the items are also dropped when the chest is broken. If one half of a large chest is destroyed, the corresponding items from the destroyed chest are dropped and the remaining half continues to function as a small chest.

In Java Edition, a chest produces oak plank particles when breaking, walking or falling on this block;[1] in Bedrock Edition, a chest produces particles of the block itself.
Natural generation[edit | edit source]
See also: Chest loot
Chests generate naturally in all three dimensions. They can generate in monster rooms, strongholds, villages, jungle pyramids, desert pyramids, nether fortresses, end cities, igloo basements, woodland mansions, shipwrecks, ocean ruins, buried treasure, pillager outposts, bastion remnants, ruined portals, ancient cities and trial chambers.
Large chests can occasionally generate in monster rooms by one single chest generating next to the other. They can also generate in certain types of bastion remnants.
Bonus chest[edit | edit source]
Main article: Bonus chest
The bonus chest is a chest that appears near the player's spawn if the ""Bonus chest"" option is toggled on the world creation screen. It generates with a semi-random collection of basic items to help the player survive early on and gather necessary resources, including wood, tools, blocks, and food.

Usage[edit | edit source]
Chests can be used as containers and are an ingredient in some crafting recipes.
A chest placed adjacent to another chest joins to create a large chest. A player can prevent this, and place two small chests side by side, by sneaking while placing the second chest in Java Edition, pushing a chest into place with a piston in Bedrock Edition, or placing the second chest facing a different direction from the first chest. Alternatively, trapped chests do not combine with normal chests.
In Bedrock Edition, chests can be moved by pistons. Water and lava flow around chests without affecting them. Lava can create fire in air blocks next to chests as if the chests were flammable, but the chests do not actually catch fire and cannot be burned.
Container[edit | edit source]
It has been suggested that this page be moved to Inventory#Chest.
If this move affects many pages or may potentially be controversial, do not move the page until a consensus is reached. [discuss]
Reason: Most of this GUI information applies to all inventories.
When moving, be sure to use the appropriate tool instead of simply copying and pasting the page's contents, to preserve edit history.
The GUI of a chest.
The GUI of a large chest.
A small chest has 27 slots of inventory space, and a large chest has twice that amount, at 54 slots. In the Java Edition interface, the top three rows for a large chest correspond to the left half of the chest when facing it, and the bottom three rows correspond to the right half. In Bedrock Edition, the top three rows correspond to whichever half was placed first and the bottom three to the other half.
Chests open when used. To move items between the chest inventory and the player inventory or hotbar while the chest GUI is open, drag or shift-click the items. In Java Edition, holding Shift and double-clicking while holding an item moves all items of the type clicked on in or out of the chest, to the extent that space is available for them. To exit the chest GUI, use the Esc control.
A chest cannot be opened if there is a conductive block above it (in Bedrock Edition, bottom slabs prevent chests from being opened). Solid faces do not prevent chests from opening, so the lid of the chest can phase through blocks such as bottom-half slabs, stairs, and non-conductive full cubes such as glass and ice. Cats sitting on chests prevent them from opening. Because chests themselves are non-conductive, two chests can be stacked on top of one another while still allowing the lower chest to be opened. Players can open chests when they are being hurt (effect of Instant Damage, Poison, Wither, on fire, damaged by other players or mobs, etc.).
By default, the GUI of a chest is labeled ""Chest"" and the GUI of a large chest is labeled ""Large Chest"". A chest's GUI label can be changed by naming the chest in an anvil before placing it, or, in Java Edition, by using the /data command (for example, to label a chest at (0,64,0) as ""Bonus Chest!"", use /data merge block 0 64 0 {CustomName:'""Bonus Chest!""'}). If half of a large chest is renamed, that name is used to label the GUI of the entire large chest, but if the named half is destroyed the other half reverts to the default label. If both halves of a large chest have different names, the GUI uses the name of the northernmost or westernmost half.
In Java Edition, a chest can be ""locked"" by setting its [String] Lock tag using the /data command. If a chest's [String] Lock tag is not blank, the chest cannot be opened unless the player is holding an item with the same name as the Lock tag's text. For example, to lock a chest at (0,64,0) so that the chest cannot be opened unless the player is holding an item named ""Chest Key"", use /data merge block 0 64 0 {Lock:""Chest Key""}.
The capacity of a chest varies greatly, depending on its size, whether the items inside it are stackable, and whether shulker boxes are used. The minimum capacity is obtained when storing only non-stackable items while the maximum capacity can be achieved when storing items that stack to 64. Filled shulker boxes are not stackable, but each can hold 27 stacks of up to 64 items (excluding other shulker boxes), so filling a chest with them increases the maximum by a factor of 27.
Chest size Slots Maximum number of items
Without shulker boxes With shulker boxes
Small 27 1,728 46,656
Large 54 3,456 93,312
Donkey, mule, or llama pack[edit | edit source]
A chest can be added to a donkey, a mule, or a llama by pressing use on the animal.
A chest attached to a donkey or mule has only 15 slots. A chest attached to a llama has anywhere from 3 to 15 slots depending on its ""Strength"" value (see Llama § Data values). The chest cannot be removed except by killing the carrier. The chest can be opened by holding sneak and pressing use, or by riding the carrier and pressing inventory.
If shulker boxes are again used, each donkey, mule or strength value 5 llamas with a chest attached to it can carry up to 405 stacks of items (up to 25920 items), and with strength value 5 llamas, each caravan of 10 llamas with inventories full of shulker boxes can carry up to 4050 stacks of items (up to 259200 items).
Piglins[edit | edit source]
Piglins become hostile toward players who open or mine chests.

Fuel[edit | edit source]
Chests can be used as fuel in furnaces, smelting 1.5 items per chest.
Note blocks[edit | edit source]
Chests can be placed under note blocks to produce the ""bass"" sound.
Christmas chest[edit | edit source]
This feature is exclusive to Java Edition. 
On December 24–26, chests, large chests, and their trapped chest counterparts have their textures changed to ""Christmas chests"" that look like wrapped Christmas presents. Since the game uses the date stored on the player's computer, players can apply the Christmas chest textures at any time by changing the date on their computer to December 24, 25, or 26.

[hide]
Java Edition Indev
0.31 20100124 Added chests and large chests.
Chests are considered a solid block.
The front of the chest (with the latch) faces away from any adjacent solid blocks, or faces west if placed independent of other blocks.
If a chest is placed next to a large chest, it attempts to ""connect"" with the large one, changing its texture to that of half a large chest. However, this is purely visual; they still act like two separate chests. Additionally, if the player attempts to open a chest connected on all four sides, the game freezes and the client crashes.
20100130 Chests can now be crafted.
[hide]
Java Edition Infdev
20100625-1917 Chests now generate in the newly added monster rooms.
[hide]
Java Edition Alpha
v1.0.14 Chests are now used to craft chest minecarts.
[hide]
Java Edition Beta
1.1_02 The placement of chests has been partially fixed. It is still possible to create triple chests, if the chest was not placed horizontally adjacent to a large chest or if placed in the location of a fluid.
The game no longer freezes, but instead displays a graphically glitched, fully functional chest screen.
1.5 Chests can no longer be placed to create a triple chest; however, any chest previously created in this way still functions in that manner.
Shift + clicking on an item or a stack while the chest is opened moves it between the chest and the inventory.
1.8 Pre-release The chest's model has been redone. Rather than a usual cube, it uses an entity model, which allows for an opening and closing animation, and is also smaller.
This conversion to an entity model resulted in anomalies with the chest's item form. When held (in both first person and in third person/by other players) , it is shown at a different angle from other blocks, and when dropped on the ground , it rotates around one of its corners rather than its center, with its shadow also centered on this corner.
Chests now use textures in the ""item"" folder; ""chest.png"" is used for single chests and ""chestlarge.png"" is used for large chests.
The particles for chests (when sprinted on, broken, or later when walked on by an iron golem) still use the texture in terrain.png that was used for the sides[verify] of chests before this version.
Chests now change the direction they face based on the viewpoint of the player that places them, rather than adjusting by themselves based on adjacent blocks.
Chests no longer show the block breaking animation.
Chests can now be found in mineshafts, as well as the libraries and storerooms of strongholds.
[hide]
Java Edition
1.0.0 Beta 1.9 Prerelease The opening and closing sound effects of the chest have been removed (it used the same sounds as the door).

The old chest top texture was still used for the block particles up until this version, even after the model change. As the texture has been removed in this version, the oak planks texture is now used for the chest's particles.[2]
Chests can now be found in desert pyramids.
12w22a The chest item is now aligned more like other item forms of blocks, resulting in a more natural first-person holding position as well as the item form appearing properly aligned in third person as well as when dropped.
Chests can now be found in jungle pyramids.
12w24a Large chest inventory titles have changed from ""Large chest"" to ""Large Chest"".
1.4.4 1.4.3 Chests now have a smaller hitbox. Previously, the hitbox was that of a full cube; it now fits the newer size and shape of the chest.

From this point on, each blockstate correctly displays the associated half, although still, only one displays an opening/closing animation.[is this the correct version?]

Breaking[edit | edit source]
Chiseled bookshelves can be destroyed with any tool, but an axe mines it the fastest. When broken, all contained books are dropped as items. The block itself drops only when broken using a tool enchanted with Silk Touch.[1]

Usage[edit | edit source]
Chiseled bookshelves cannot be moved by pistons.‌[Java Edition only]
Holding books[edit | edit source]
All of the chiseled bookshelf textures before 22w46a.
Chiseled bookshelves can hold up to six books, books and quills, written books, enchanted books, and/or knowledge books. There is no GUI; books are instead added into the bookshelf by using on a slot with a book. Doing so places a book in that slot. Using on an occupied slot removes the book from that slot.
Chiseled bookshelves do not increase the power of enchanting tables.
Redstone signal[edit | edit source]
The correspondences between slot and signal power.
A redstone comparator sends a signal (1–6) indicating the last slot interacted with. When no slot has been interacted with yet, it outputs 0.
An observer can detect when a book is added or removed from the bookshelf.
Hoppers, minecarts with hopper, and droppers[edit | edit source]
Hoppers and minecart with hoppers can insert and remove books from the bookshelf. As with any other container, items are taken from the first slot that has an item that can fit in the hopper and are inserted into the first empty slot. Droppers behave similarly when inserting books into the bookshelf.
When a hopper that is not already 100% full fails to remove a book from a non-empty bookshelf because there is no room for the book in the hopper's inventory, that is still counted as an ""interaction"" with the slot. Thus, a hopper that cannot remove any of the books effectively sets the last-interacted slot to the last non-empty slot in the bookshelf.[2]
Fuel[edit | edit source]
Chiseled bookshelves can be used as fuel in furnaces to smelt 1.5 items.
Note blocks[edit | edit source]
Chiseled bookshelves can be placed under note blocks to produce a ""bass"" sound.

Usage[edit | edit source]
Chiseled copper is a decorative block that oxidizes over time.
Oxidation[edit | edit source]
Main article: Oxidation
Non-waxed chiseled copper has four stages of oxidation (including the initial normal state). Lightning bolts and axes can remove the oxidation on chiseled copper. Using a honeycomb on chiseled copper prevents it from oxidizing further.
As the block begins to oxidize (exposed), it gets discolored and green spots begin to appear. As the oxidation continues (weathered), the block is a green color with brown spots. In the last stage (oxidized), the block is teal with several green spots.

Natural generation[edit | edit source]
Chorus flowers are naturally generated in the End at the top of chorus trees, in their fully-grown state.
Usage[edit | edit source]
Chorus flowers are used to grow chorus plants. They can be planted on end stone in any dimension.
Chorus flowers can be pollinated by bees.
Farming[edit | edit source]
Chorus flowers can be planted on end stone and grow in any dimension, regardless of light level. A flower stops growing once it has reached age 5 (appearing purple rather than white), but may be harvested and replanted to reset the age. Chorus flowers do not grow if planted 1 block below the surface of the ground.
Placement and growth[edit | edit source]
Final heights of 500,000 chorus plants (blue) and heights of 500,000 chorus flowers from full-grown plants (orange).
Placement
Chorus flowers must be above end stone or chorus plant, or be above air and horizontally adjacent to exactly one chorus plant. If these conditions are not met, the block breaks without dropping anything.
Growth conditions and algorithm
Each block tick until the flower reaches age 5, the flower attempts to grow if the block above is air. The flower does not age if growth is not attempted due to lack of an air block above. Bone meal has no effect on growth.[1]
The flower may attempt to grow upward depending on the structure of chorus plant blocks directly beneath:
100% chance if zero or one plant block is directly beneath
60% if the flower is above a two-block unbranched plant (i.e. two plant blocks over end stone)
50% if above a two-block high branch (i.e. two plant blocks over air)
40% if above a three-block unbranched plant
25% if above a three-block high branch
20% if above a four-block unbranched plant
The growth attempt succeeds if the blocks horizontally adjacent to and above the target block above are all air, and results in the target block becoming a flower block with the same age while the existing flower block turns to chorus plant.
If upward growth does not occur and the flower's age is less than 4, the flower may attempt to branch horizontally. 1–4 branches are attempted on an unbranched plant or 0–3 on a branched plant. For each branch a horizontal direction is chosen at random, and if the block in that direction is an air block with more air blocks on all other horizontal sides and an air block below, it is replaced with a flower with age incremented by 1. If at least one branch succeeds, the original flower block is turned to chorus plant.
Upon a successful growth attempt, the chorus flower emits a low-pitched sound, similar to the sound endermen emit when teleporting.
If no growth occurs on a growth attempt, the flower's age is set to 5.
Flowers and plant height
The amount of chorus flowers a player gets from a fully and unrestricted grown chorus plant ranges from 1 to 8, averaging at around 3.7 flowers per plant.
Plant heights range from 5 to (rarely) 22 above the end stone block on which the original chorus flower was planted, with over half falling in the range 13–16. Flower heights range from 3 to (rarely) 22, with over half falling in the range 11–16 above the end stone block.
Bee nests[edit | edit source]
Oak, birch, and cherry trees grown from saplings that are within 2 blocks of a chorus flower have a 5% chance to grow with a bee nest and 2-3 bees in it.

Issues relating to ""Chorus Flower"" are maintained on the bug tracker. Issues should be reported and viewed there.
Trivia[edit | edit source]
The smallest possible fully-grown chorus tree (assuming the growth is not disturbed) would have only 5 chorus plant blocks, and the tree (including the flower) would be 5 blocks high. The largest possible tree would be 22 blocks high.
When flowers reach age five, breaking them and replanting them on the same chorus plant block (even on a different face) can allow the plant to grow further.

Obtaining[edit | edit source]
The block form cannot be obtained in Survival mode, even with the Silk Touch enchantment; however, it is available in the Creative inventory.
Breaking[edit | edit source]
Chorus plants can be broken using any tool, but an axe is the quickest. Breaking one block of a chorus tree generally causes all chorus plants and flowers above to break due to lack of support. Upon breaking, a chorus plant drops 0–1 chorus fruit. This is not affected by Fortune.[1]

Natural generation[edit | edit source]
Chorus plants make up most of the chorus trees that are naturally generated on the outer islands of the End. Chorus trees are typically 10–15 blocks in height, although a single plant can reach up to 22 blocks.
Post-generation[edit | edit source]
Chorus plants are generated as chorus flowers grow.
Usage[edit | edit source]
Chorus plants can be broken to obtain chorus fruit.
Support[edit | edit source]
Chorus plant blocks break automatically (with a 50% chance of dropping fruit), if the six surrounding blocks are not valid:
a chorus plant with at least one other chorus plant horizontally adjacent breaks unless at least one of the vertically adjacent blocks is air
a chorus plant breaks unless the block below is chorus plant or end stone or any horizontally adjacent block is a chorus plant above chorus plant or end stone

Trivia[edit | edit source]
Using commands, it is possible to make chorus trees grow to heights not normally possible. This works because commands can reset the time value of chorus flowers, allowing them to grow indefinitely.
Because breaking one part of the plant breaks all parts above it, cutting a large plant can cause a brief performance drop.
The chorus plant is named due to the sound it makes when it grows.[2]

There is a related tutorial page for this topic! 
See Tutorial:Clay and Mud farming.
Clay is a block that can be found abundantly in lush caves, in patches in shallow surface water or converted from mud using pointed dripstone. It can be smelted into terracotta or broken into clay balls which are smeltable into bricks.

Clay blocks can be mined with any item, but shovels are quickest. Destroying a clay block yields 4 clay balls. If broken with a tool enchanted with Silk Touch, it drops itself instead. Destroying a clay block with a tool enchanted with Fortune does not increase the amount of clay dropped.

Natural generation[edit | edit source]
Clay generates in large quantities on the floors of ponds in lush caves.
Clay can also generate in lush caves in the form of blobs. Clay attempts to generate 46 times per chunk in blobs of size 0-160, at any height. It can replace stone, granite, andesite, diorite, polished granite‌[BE only], polished andesite‌[BE only], polished diorite‌[BE only], tuff‌[JE only], and deepslate‌[JE only].
Clay is found underwater in swamps, beaches, oceans, and at the bottoms of rivers and lakes in shallow, crystal-shaped disks, disregarding adjacency to other types of blocks.
Clay generates in mason houses in plains, savanna, and desert villages, and under fisher cottages in taiga villages.

In Java Edition, when the player has the Hero of the Village status effect, a mason villager might throw that player a clay block as a gift.
Post-generation[edit | edit source]
If mud is placed above a block with a pointed dripstone underneath, the mud eventually turns into clay, although the dripstone does not deposit any water into a cauldron. This conversion does not happen in the Nether.[1]
Usage[edit | edit source]
Big dripleaves and small dripleaves are the only plants that can be placed on clay. Unlike most other blocks, clay supports small dripleaves even outside of water.

Obtaining[edit | edit source]
Breaking[edit | edit source]
Coal ore itself can be obtained by mining it with any pickaxe enchanted with Silk Touch. When mined without Silk Touch, it drops one coal. It is affected by the Fortune enchantment, dropping 1–2, 1–3, or 1–4 coal respectively with Fortune I, II, and III. It also drops 0–2XP when mined. Fortune does not affect the amount of experience dropped.

Natural generation[edit | edit source]
See also: Ore (feature)
Coal ore can generate in the Overworld in the form of ore blobs. It generates in two batches per chunk. The first batch attempts to generate 30 times per chunk in blobs of 0-37, evenly from levels 136 to 320. The second batch attempts to generate 20 times per chunk in blobs of 0-37, from levels 0 to 192, being most common at Y=96, and being less common toward either end of the range. Coal ore in this second batch is also less likely to be exposed to air: 50% of ore blocks that would generate exposed do not generate. In Bedrock Edition, coal ore also has the third batches, which attempts to generate 20 times per chunk in blobs of size 0-37, evenly from levels 128 to 256, within any type of mountains biomes.
Coal ore can replace stone, andesite, diorite, granite, tuff, and deepslate. Deepslate coal ore generates when replacing tuff or deepslate, which is a rare occurrence due to the rarity of coal blobs below Y=8 where deepslate generates.
Coal ore is also found in small amounts alongside underground fossils.

Coarse dirt has the ability to grow saplings, sugar canes, mushrooms, bamboo, flowers, and sweet berries, which can be planted directly under appropriate conditions.
Neither mycelium nor grass can spread onto coarse dirt.
Coarse dirt can be tilled using a hoe to become normal dirt. There must be an empty space above the coarse dirt for it to be tilled.
Using any type of shovel on coarse dirt turns it into a dirt path.
Mud[edit | edit source]
Using a water bottle, splash water bottle or lingering water bottle converts the coarse dirt into mud.

Natural generation[edit | edit source]
Cobbled deepslate generates naturally in ancient cities and trial chambers.
Usage[edit | edit source]
Cobbled deepslate can be used as a substitute for cobblestone as it can be used to craft stone tools, brewing stands, and furnaces as well as to repair stone tools with an anvil. It can also be used to craft polished deepslate.
Cobbled deepslate cannot be used to craft dispensers, droppers, pistons, or other blocks that use cobblestone in their recipes. This is intended per MC-177904.
The quickest way to get derivative blocks such as deepslate tile walls from cobbled deepslate is to use a stonecutter. Using a crafting table requires multiple steps.

Obtaining[edit | edit source]
Breaking[edit | edit source]
Cobblestone can be mined using a pickaxe, in which case it drops itself. If mined without a pickaxe, it drops nothing. Its hardness is greater than stone so it requires more time to break, especially with anything other than a pickaxe.

↑ These durations ignore other influential factors (e.g. Mining Fatigue), and are measured in seconds. For more information, see Breaking § Speed.
Cobblestone is dropped by stone when mined without Silk Touch, and also by infested cobblestone when mined with Silk Touch.
Natural generation[edit | edit source]
Cobblestone occurs naturally in monster rooms, jungle pyramids, pillager outposts, ocean ruins, strongholds, plains, taiga, snowy plains, desert, and savanna villages, woodland mansions, trail ruins and in trial chambers surrounding baby zombies spawners alongside mossy cobblestone.
In Java Edition, a single block of cobblestone always generates at the coordinates of (8, -61, 8) at the center of the void start platform, in Superflat worlds created with the Void biome preset.
Post-generation[edit | edit source]
See also: Tutorials/Cobblestone farming
When water and flowing lava come into contact, the flowing lava is replaced by cobblestone. However, if the lava flows on top of the water from above, stone is created instead. Non-flowing lava (a lava source block) turns into obsidian upon contact with water, thus the requirement of flowing lava.
Usage[edit | edit source]
Cobblestone can be used as a basic building block, as it has relatively high blast resistance and is extremely common.
Silverfish[edit | edit source]
Silverfish can enter and hide in cobblestone, creating an infested block.

Java Edition Infdev
20100629 Added stone stairs.
The inventory icon for stone stairs is a flat cobblestone texture.
[hide]
Java Edition Alpha
v1.0.1 The inventory icon for stone stairs has been changed to an image of a render of them, which is glitched.
v1.2.0 preview The orientation of stone stairs is now determined based on the direction the player faces while placing them. Before this version, they would determine their orientation based on the surrounding blocks (changing if they were changed).
v1.2.2 Stone stairs now have an odd property of being transparent to light; when there is at least one block of air beneath, sunlight or other light sources shine through and light up blocks beneath or behind the stairs as if nothing opaque are present between them.
Other atmospheric effects such as snowfall do not penetrate stone stair blocks.
Snow cannot accumulate on top of stone stairs, grass is able to grow on a block directly underneath them and disappears if stone stairs were placed on top of it. Any stone stairs placed between Alpha v1.2.0_02 and Beta 1.5 would keep this property in later versions until it or an adjacent block is changed or removed, causing a lighting update.
[hide]
Java Edition Beta
1.0 Items have been given in-game names. The block has been named ""Stone Stairs"".
1.6 Test Build 3 The light transparency of stone stairs from Alpha v1.2.2 has been fixed.

Stone stairs now generate in strongholds.

The model of stone stairs has been changed.
1.3.1 12w22a Stone stairs now generate in jungle temples.

15w45a The cobblestone stair texture is no longer incorrectly stretched.
However it is now incorrectly mapped in a different way.[2]
15w46a Cobblestone stair texture mapping has now been corrected. It is not known, however, if cobblestone stairs from this version onward look at all different from those before 15w44b.
1.11 16w39a Cobblestone stairs now generate in woodland mansions.
1.12 17w15a Torches can now be placed on the full-block sides of cobblestone stairs.
Iron bars, glass panes and fences adjacent to the full-block side of cobblestone stairs now visually connect.
Carpet and snow layers can now be placed on top of upside down cobblestone stairs.
1.13 18w10c Water can now be placed on the same block as cobblestone stairs.
1.14 18w43a The texture of cobblestone stairs has been changed.
18w46a Cobblestone stairs now allow light to pass through certain faces.
18w50a The texture for cobblestone stairs has been changed.

A stack of cobblestone crafted into cobblestone walls (which use only 60 of the 64 cobblestones) makes exactly enough walls to fence off one chunk. However, using a stonecutter can make 64 cobblestone walls without any cobblestone left, rather than 60.

Obtaining[edit | edit source]
Breaking[edit | edit source]
Cobwebs can be obtained as an item using shears. Cobwebs can also be obtained with a sword enchanted with Silk Touch, which is possible only through commands or while in Creative mode‌[JE only]. A cobweb drops one piece of string if broken with a non-Silk Touch sword, if water touches or flows over it, or a piston pushes it. Breaking cobwebs costs two durability on a sword. It drops nothing when broken using anything else, or if lava flows over it.

Natural generation[edit | edit source]
Cobwebs generate naturally in mineshafts, stronghold libraries, igloo basements, abandoned villages, woodland mansion spider spawner rooms, and trial chambers around specific trial spawners.
Post-generation[edit | edit source]
When an entity with the effect of Weaving is killed, the game attempts to place cobwebs nearby.
Usage[edit | edit source]
Mobs can spawn inside of cobwebs. Cobwebs also diffuse sky light. Undead mobs do not catch fire from sunlight if they are under a cobweb or their head is inside a cobweb.
Blocks can be placed on cobwebs. Paintings‌[Java Edition only] and signs can be placed on their sides, or on top in the case of signs.
Despite being slowed down by them, mobs do not try to pathfind around cobwebs, which can be exploited to construct clever mob traps.
Redstone circuits[edit | edit source]
2 cobwebs delay for around a minute
Cobwebs can be used as a delaying mechanism in a redstone circuit, for example, to delay an item falling on a pressure plate or into a hopper. They can also be used to cancel random momentum of an item thrown from a dispenser or dropper by placing them directly on their face.
Effects[edit | edit source]
All mobs except for spiders and cave spiders experience slow movement through a cobweb. A mob falling through a cobweb takes 13 seconds to move down 1 block. A cobweb can partially stop blast damage if a player and the entity causing the explosion are both caught in the cobweb.
A cobweb affects the player's movement abilities, as well. While in contact with it, the player can move at a speed of about 25% of the normal walking speed, and their jumping height is severely reduced. A cobweb also limits the rate at which a player can break blocks. Like water, falling into a cobweb prevents a player from taking fall damage, meaning a fatal fall can be mitigated with cobwebs. Attacking while falling through cobwebs counts as a critical hit, the same as when falling after a jump.
Players and mobs affected by the Weaving effect move through cobwebs at 50% of their normal speed instead of 25%.
The slowing effect of the cobweb increases if it is placed on ice. The slowest a player can move in vanilla Minecraft without commands or other third-party tools is by placing cobwebs on blue ice, sneaking, drinking a level IV Turtle Master potion, and blocking, which causes the player come to a near-total standstill, moving only a single block every few minutes.
Items thrown into a cobweb are slowed and fall through it after a maximum of about 24 seconds depending on where it enters. They do not merge with other items of the same type thrown on the ground.
Cobwebs have different effects on other moving entities. An arrow shot at a cobweb passes through without being slowed. In Java Edition, a falling block that enters a cobweb slows down, then drops as an item after existing for 30 seconds.
A minecart with no players in it takes about 9 seconds to fall through a cobweb if a rail is placed directly under the cobweb, however, if there is air between the cobweb and the rail, the minecart takes about 34 seconds to fall. Every extra cobweb added gives an additional 25 seconds of falling time. Players are unaffected by cobwebs when in a minecart unless they come into direct contact.

Obtaining[edit | edit source]
In Java Edition, cocoa beans are only obtained through the natural generation of cocoa pods, while in Bedrock Edition, they can also be found in bonus chests, from fishing inside the jungle, bamboo jungle and sparse jungle biomes and from trading with a wandering trader[verify].
Cocoa beans come from cocoa pods, which are found on the trunks of normal-sized naturally-generated jungle trees in jungle, bamboo jungle and sparse jungle biomes.
The block itself can be obtained by inventory editing or add-ons in Bedrock Edition.
Breaking[edit | edit source]
Cocoa pods can be mined with any item, but axes are the quickest. Fully grown cocoa pods drop 3 cocoa beans. Using a tool enchanted with Fortune does not increase the amount of cocoa beans dropped.

Usage[edit | edit source]
Farming[edit | edit source]
A somewhat efficient cocoa pod farm, minimizing space and wood use.
Main article: Tutorials/Cocoa bean farming
Placing cocoa beans on the side of a jungle log plants a new cocoa pod. The log does not need to be attached to a tree. A cocoa pod can be placed on jungle logs, jungle wood, stripped jungle logs and stripped jungle wood.
Cocoa has three stages of growth. During its first stage, the pod is small and green. In the second stage, the plant is bigger and colored tan. In its last stage, the pod is even larger and orange. The cocoa block has a 20% chance to grow a stage when receiving a random tick, giving it an average time of 5 minutes and 41 seconds per stage. When destroyed in the first two stages, the pod yields only one cocoa bean. When destroyed in the third stage, it gives 3 cocoa beans. Bone meal can be used to force the cocoa pod forward by one growth stage. Cocoa pods burst and drop their beans when struck by flowing water, pushed by a piston or if their log or wood are removed by any means.
Composting[edit | edit source]
Placing cocoa beans into a composter has a 65% chance of raising the compost level by 1.

Data history[edit | edit source]

Java Edition
1.3.1 12w19a Cocoa with values 12–15 is inaccessible normally, and use the texture of the dragon egg. This is due to the dragon egg texture being to the left of the ripe cocoa texture in terrain.png, as cocoa textures are arranged with the oldest on the left and the youngest on the right, resulting in the unusually ripe cocoa reading the dragon egg texture.
1.5 13w02a Due to textures being stored in individual files, cocoa beans with data 12–15 no longer have a texture to use, and now crash the game if a chunk containing one is loaded.
13w03a Cocoa with data values 12–15 now only crash the game if one is directly in the field of view.
13w10a Cocoa with data 12–15 now use the age 2 texture, resulting in a broken appearance, preventing previously mentioned crashes.
1.8 14w07a Cocoa of age 3 no longer has a model.
14w10a The missing model (which age 3 cocoa uses) has changed.
14w26a Cocoa with data 12–15 has been effectively removed from the game, as such blocks now convert to a proper value with /setblock. Loading worlds with existing out of range cocoa crash the game.
1.13 17w47a The different data values for the dye ID have been split up into their own IDs.
Prior to The Flattening, this block's and item's numeral ID were respectively 127 and 351.

Issues[edit | edit source]
Issues relating to ""Cocoa Beans"" or ""Cocoa Pod"" are maintained on the bug tracker. Issues should be reported and viewed there.
Trivia[edit | edit source]
Cocoa pods have a different hitbox for each size; however, the top is always 0.25 blocks below the top of the log it is on.
If a cocoa pod grows while the player is standing next to it, the player is forced into the appropriate form of suffocation prevention depending on available space.
In Bedrock Edition, the pixels on top of the fully grown pod are 8/7 the size of those on the side.[4][5]

Usage[edit | edit source]
Torches can be placed on the top or the sides of most solid blocks, although some require sneaking (see placement for exceptions). Being non-solid, torches have no collision box.
Gravity-affected blocks like sand and gravel do not fall if the block below them has a torch on it and break when falling onto a torch.
Light[edit | edit source]
Torches emit a light level of 14. Torches also melt snow layers within 2 blocks and ice within 3 blocks (taxicab distance). Colored torches emit normal light, not colored light, and therefore the coloring is purely aesthetic.
Placement[edit | edit source]
In general, torches can be placed only on solid, opaque, full blocks; exceptions are listed below.
Block name Torch placeable

Fence Top only

A command block is a block that can execute commands. Because it cannot be obtained or used in Survival mode without cheats, it is primarily used in multiplayer servers, Creative worlds, and custom maps.
An impulse command block is the default block type; it executes only once when activated.
A chain command block executes every time when triggered.
A repeating command block executes every game tick as long as it is activated.

Obtaining[edit | edit source]
In Java Edition, command blocks are available in the Creative inventory under the ""Operator Utilities"" tab, if the ""Operator Items Tab"" setting in the ""Controls"" Options tab is set to ""ON"". Across both Java and Bedrock editions, they can either be obtained by using various commands, such as /give @s minecraft:command_block or /setblock ~ ~ ~ command_block, or by pressing the pick block control on an existing command block. Just like other blocks that can store NBT data, using pick block + CTRL copies the command and options inside the command block. This allows it to be placed elsewhere without having to re-enter the data inside.
Command blocks are not flammable, and have the same blast resistance as bedrock. Command blocks, structure blocks, and jigsaw blocks cannot be mined in Survival.
Command blocks cannot be placed by a non-operator player.
Usage[edit | edit source]
See also: Commands and Tutorials/Command blocks and functions
A command block can execute commands when activated by redstone power. It always has permissions of level 2‌[Java Edition only]/level 1‌[Bedrock Edition only], so it can be used to allow a specific use of a command by players who can't use that command in general (for example, allowing anyone to obtain a specific item with /give without allowing everyone to /give themselves whatever they want).
A command block has an orientation that determines the chain command block to activate, and the blocks to be checked to see if a command block in ""Conditional"" mode executes.
To execute the command, in Java Edition in multiplayer enable-command-block in the server.properties file must be set to true (default is false); in Bedrock Edition ""Command Blocks Enabled"" in options must be enabled.
Modification[edit | edit source]
Java Edition command block GUI
To enter command or modify the command block, use the Use Item control on the command block to open the command block GUI (graphical user interface). The GUI opens only if the player is in Creative mode, and has the proper permissions. That means, in singleplayer, ""Allow Cheats""‌[JE only] or ""Activate Cheats""‌[BE only] in options must be enabled. In multiplayer, GUI can be opened only by operators in Creative mode, and in Java Edition op-permission-level in the server.properties file must be set to 2 or above (default is 4).
In Java Edition to enter command or modify the command block, enable-command-block in the server.properties file must be set to true (default is false).
Bedrock edition command block GUI
In Java Edition, opening the GUI in singleplayer pauses the game.
Console Command‌[JE only]/Command Input‌[BE only]
Commands can be entered in the top text pane. The text limit for commands in a command block is 32,500 characters, but the text pane can show only a small portion of this amount at a time.
Commands in a command block do not need to be prefixed with the forward-slash (/) as they do in the chat window, but doing so still works.
Press Tab ↹ to complete words or cycle through options.
In Bedrock Edition, below the console command text pane are some reminder tips about how to use target selectors.
Previous Output
The bottom text pane displays the output message (success or failure) of the last executed command (it is blank‌[JE only] or "" - ""‌[BE only] initially). Its text is not editable.
A button to the right of the Previous Output text pane‌[JE only] or the left of the ""Previous Output""‌[BE only] specifies whether the last output should be stored and displayed. It is O‌[JE only]/enabled‌[BE only] when the output text should be stored and X‌[JE only]/disabled‌[BE only] when the output text should not be stored. For worlds with many command blocks, especially command blocks running on fast clocks, not storing the output text can reduce memory and storage requirements.
If gamerule sendCommandFeedback is true (the default), default to O‌[JE only]/enabled‌[BE only]. Otherwise defaults to X‌[JE only]/disabled‌[BE only].
Block Type
Left: ""Impulse"" block type.
Middle: ""Chain"" block type.
Right: ""Repeating"" block type.
Top: ""Unconditional"" mode.
Bottom: ""Conditional"" mode.
Click the ""Impulse/Chain/Repeat"" button‌[JE only]/""Block Type:"" dropdown menu‌[BE only] to change the command block's type. The default state is ""Impulse"", but non-default command blocks can be obtained and placed. The command block also changes color when changing its command block type:
""Impulse"" command blocks are orange. They execute once every time they are activated.
""Chain"" command blocks are cyan. They execute once every time they are triggered if they have been activated.
""Repeat"" command blocks are purple. They execute their commands once every one game tick (or more‌[BE only]) as long as they are activated.
Condition
Click the ""Conditional/Unconditional"" button‌[JE only]/""Condition:"" dropdown menu‌[BE only] to change the command block's conditional behavior:
""Conditional"": A command block in conditional mode executes its command only when the command block behind it has executed successfully (""Success count"" is greater than 0).
""Unconditional"" (default): A command block in unconditional mode executes its command even if there's a command block behind it that didn't execute its command successfully.
""Behind it"" in the sense of opposite to the direction the command block is facing, regardless of chain direction or even if chaining is occurring.
Redstone
Click the ""Always Active/Needs Redstone"" button‌[JE only]/""Redstone:"" dropdown menu‌[BE only] to change the command block's activation requirements:
""Needs Redstone"" (the default for impulse and repeat command blocks): A command block in the ""Needs Redstone"" setting can be activated only with redstone.
""Always Active"" (the default for chain command blocks): The command block is activated when set to ""Always Active"". Then it is always active even without redstone activation.
Execute on First Tick‌[BE only]
Specifies whether a repeat command block executes its command as soon as it is activated. If it's disabled, executes the first time after the delay from the time when it is activated.
Delay in Ticks‌[BE only]
For impulse or chain command block, specifies how many game ticks it delays before executing a command after it is activated or triggered.
For repeat command block, specifies how many game ticks it delays to execute again.
Note that for impulse or repeat command block, 0 and 1 work the same; the game takes 0 as 1. However, For chain command block, 0 and 1 are different.
Hover Note‌[BE only]
Specifies the name of the command block, which can be seen when you point to the block. It is also used for message commands. If the command block had been named in an anvil before placement, that name is used as well. If it is empty, defaults to !.
Done
In Java Edition, click the ""Done"" button or Enter to save the command and leave the command block GUI.
In Bedrock Edition, close the GUI to save the command and changes.
Cancel
Click the ""Cancel"" button or Esc‌[JE only]to leave the command block GUI without saving any changes.
Activation[edit | edit source]
Command blocks are redstone mechanisms and can be activated by:
An adjacent active power component: for example, a lever, a block of redstone, a daylight sensor, a button etc.
An adjacent powered block (for example, an opaque block with an active redstone torch under it)
A powered redstone comparator or redstone repeater facing the mechanism component
Powered redstone dust configured to point at the command block (or on top of it) or directionless; a command block is not activated by adjacent powered redstone dust that is configured to point away from it.
A command block can also be activated by setting it to ""Always Active"" mode.
When activated, a command block executes its command, depending on the command block's type:
An impulse command block executes its command once.
A chain command block does not execute its command until it is triggered.
A repeat command block executes its command once every one game tick (or more‌[BE only]) until no longer activated.
Execution[edit | edit source]
An impulse command block, when it is activated, checks whether the command block behind it has executed successfully (if in conditional mode). After the delay of 1 game tick (or more‌[BE only]), if the condition is met before the delay (if in ""Conditional"" mode), it executes its command once and triggers the chain command block it is pointing to.
A repeat command block, when it is activated, after 1 game tick (always 1 no matter how many ""Delay in Ticks"" is), checks whether the command block behind it has executed successfully (if in conditional mode). If the condition is met, and if ""Execute on First Tick"" is enabled in Bedrock Edition, it executes its command once and triggers the chain command block it is pointing to. If it is still activated, it then checks, executes, and triggers the chain command block again after 1 game tick (or more‌[BE only]).
When executing a command, it also updates its success count: If in ""Conditional"" mode, if the command block behind it didn't execute successfully, it sets its success count to 0. Otherwise, it sets it to the success count of the command.
Also:
When an impulse or repeat command block in ""Needs Redstone"" mode with a command is placed or is cloned by a command to a powered location, the new command block executes its command only if it hasn't been activated with redstone. In Java Edition, it also needs a block update to execute its command.
When an impulse or repeat command block in ""Always Active"" mode with a command is placed or is cloned by a command to a powered location, the new command block executes its command only if it hasn't been activated with redstone.
When an impulse or chain command block is set to ""Repeat"", if it has been activated, checks whether the command block behind it has executed successfully (if in conditional mode). After 1 game tick (always 1 no matter how many ""Delay in Ticks"" is), if the condition is met, it executes its command once and triggers the chain command block it is pointing to. Then it checks, executes, and triggers the chain command block again after 1 game tick (or more‌[BE only]).
Trigger and chaining[edit | edit source]
If any command block having executed its command (whether successfully or unsuccessfully) faces a chain command block, it triggers the chain command block to also attempt execution.
When a chain command block is triggered,
If it has been activated,
It checks whether it is in ""Conditional"" mode and the command block behind it hasn't executed successfully (Behind in the sense of the direction it is facing, not in the sense of which command block chained to it),
If true, it triggers another chain command block it is facing, without executing the command.
If false, it checks whether it has been already executed in this game tick. If false, it executes the command and triggers another chain command block it is facing. If true, it does nothing. That means that chained execution cannot be passed to a command block that has already executed in that game tick (loops execute only once).
If it has not been activated, it triggers the chain command block it is facing to attempt execution.
Chained command blocks execute simultaneously in the same game tick in the order they are chained.
In Bedrock Edition, it can also delay before executing commands if ""Delay in Ticks"" is not 0:
When it is triggered,
If it has been activated, the chain command block checks whether the command block behind it has executed successfully (if in conditional mode), then it delays.
After a delay, if the condition is met before the delay (if in ""Conditional"" mode), it executes its command once and triggers the chain command block it is pointing to no matter whether the condition met.
If it has not been activated, it triggers (without delay) the chain command block it is facing to attempt execution.
In Java Edition, it can execute multiple times in the same game tick if ""UpdateLastExecution"" is set to false. In this case, it does not check whether it has already executed in this game tick.
If the chain command block has been activated when triggered, it also updates its success count: If in ""Conditional"" mode, if the command block behind it didn't execute successfully, it sets its success count to 0. Otherwise, it sets it to the success count of the command.
Output[edit | edit source]
When activated, a command block can produce multiple types of output:
Success count[edit | edit source]
A command block can power a redstone comparator facing away from it (possibly separated by a block) with signal strength specific to the success count. Success count is an integer between 0 to 2,147,483,647 (inclusive).
The signal strength always reflects the last command executed, even after the command block is deactivated.
In Java Edition, success count is usually 0 or 1, except for /function and /execute.
In Bedrock Edition, success count is an integer related to the command (e.g., the number of players affected by the command, the number of blocks that were altered, the value returned by the command, etc.)
In Java Edition, leaving the command block GUI by clicking ""Done"" or pressing Enter resets the success count to 0, regardless of whether changes were made in the GUI. In Bedrock Edition, leaving the GUI with changes resets the success count to 0.
Message[edit | edit source]
The output message describes the success or failure of the executed command, and may be written to multiple destinations:
Previous Output: The output message is always written to the ""Previous Output"" text pane of the command block GUI.
Chat: The output message is written to the chat text in singleplayer mode, or broadcast to all other ops in multiplayer mode, unless it has been suppressed with /gamerule commandBlockOutput false. Some commands may write additional text to the chat as their normal function, which won't be suppressed (for example, the /say command writes a message to the chat of all players), separate from the output message. Chat messages that would usually be prefaced by a player's name (such as from the /me, /say and /tell commands) use @ ‌[Java Edition only] / ! ‌[Bedrock Edition only] as the player name. If the command block had been named in an anvil before placement, that name is used instead. In Bedrock Edition, it can also modified in the GUI.
Logs: The output message is written to multiplayer server logs unless it has been suppressed with /gamerule logAdminCommands false.
Notes[edit | edit source]
Command blocks execute commands with OP level 2. The following commands cannot be used in a command block: /ban, /banlist, /ban-ip, /debug, /deop, /kick‌[JE only], /op, /pardon, /pardon-ip, /publish, /reload‌[BE only], /save-all, /save-off, /save-on, /stop, /tick and /whitelist (i.e., /debug, /publish, and all of the multiplayer-only commands except /list).
Easter eggs[edit | edit source]
Main article: Easter eggs § Command blocks
Running ""Searge"" (case insensitive) as the command in the command block without a preceding ""/"" will set the previous output to ""#itzlipofutzli"". Its success count is 1.
Piston interactivity[edit | edit source]
Command blocks cannot be pushed by pistons. They also cannot be pushed or pulled by sticky pistons.

Block data[edit | edit source]
A command block has a block entity associated with it that holds additional data about the block.
Java Edition:
See also: Block entity format
[NBT Compound / JSON Object] Block entity data
Tags common to all block entities[show]
[Byte] auto: 1 or 0 (true/false) - Allows to activate the command without the requirement of a redstone signal.
[String] Command: The command to issue to the server.
[Byte] conditionMet: 1 or 0 (true/false) - Indicates whether a conditional command block had its condition met when last activated. True if not a conditional command block.
[String] CustomName: Optional. The name JSON text component of this command block, replacing the usual '@' when using commands such as /say and /tell.
[Long] LastExecution: stores the tick a chain command block was last executed in.
[String] LastOutput: The last line of output generated by the command block. Still stored even if the game rule commandBlockOutput is false. Appears in the GUI of the block when right-clicked, and includes a timestamp of when the output was produced.
[Byte] powered: 1 or 0 (true/false) - States whether or not the command block is powered by redstone or not.
[Int] SuccessCount: Represents the strength of the analog signal output by redstone comparators attached to this command block.
[Byte] TrackOutput: 1 or 0 (true/false) - Determines whether the LastOutput is stored. Can be toggled in the GUI by clicking a button near the ""Previous Output"" textbox. Caption on the button indicates current state: ""O"" if true, ""X"" if false.
[Byte] UpdateLastExecution: 1 or 0 (true/false) - Defaults to true. If set to false, loops can be created where the same command block can run multiple times in one tick.

July 27, 2012 Jeb began tweeting of a new block he had created to start expanding Adventure mode. He began posting pictures, ideas and hints of what the block can do.
July 31, 2012 During Notch's AMA on Reddit, he hinted the block may be in Java Edition 1.4.
1.4.2 12w32a Added command blocks.
12w38a Added the game rule commandBlockOutput.
1.5 13w03a Command block success can now power a redstone comparator.

1.9 15w33a The character limit for command blocks is now 32,500 instead of 32,767.
15w34a Added the chain command block and the repeating command block.
Added block facing for command blocks.
The texture of command blocks has been changed.
15w34b Added Conditional mode within command blocks.
Added tab completion support within command blocks.
15w35a The textures of all three command blocks have been changed.
When command blocks are set to conditional, the back of the arrow texture is now curved.

Obtaining[edit | edit source]
Breaking[edit | edit source]
Composters can be broken using any tool, though an axe is the fastest. The composter does not retain the compost inside; instead, it drops empty.

Natural generation[edit | edit source]
Composters generate in village farms. They can also generate in trail ruins.
Crafting[edit | edit source]
Ingredients

Crafting recipe
Any Wooden Slab

Usage[edit | edit source]
Composters can be used to recycle a selection of food and plant items into bone meal. To do so, the player must use any of a selection of items on the composter. When an adjacent comparator is facing away from the composter, a comparator signal strength of up to 8 is emitted depending on the fullness of the block.
Composters appear to have an empty interior. As such, entities can enter and exit a composter through the top, but not the sides or bottom. The composter has a ""floor"", whose height depends on the fullness. When the composter is completely empty, this floor is slightly above the block below, and when it is completely full, there is a slight dip on top. In Bedrock Edition, when the composter’s fullness increases, any entities inside are pushed up accordingly.
Composting[edit | edit source]
The composter can be filled with compost, which is done by adding compostable items to it. When successfully adding an item, a green particle () appears. The table below lists supported items, which have different levels of compostability. The higher the percentage of an item, the more likely it is for it to add another layer of compost. However, when the composter is empty, any compostable item added always creates the first layer of compost, regardless of its compostability.[1] Each layer of compost has a podzol-like appearance. When the composter reaches the 7th layer of compost, the compost changes appearance indicating that bone meal can be collected by using the composter a final time or by breaking the composter.
The following table shows the items that can be used in a composter, the percent chance for an item to add a level of compost, and the average number of items needed to fill a composter. Smaller pieces (individual pieces of wheat, melon slices, etc.) produce more compost than the blocks or other items that can be made from them. The exception is cookies, because each recipe produces 8 cookies, and together those give more than 3 times the compost.
Despite being plants, it is not possible to compost bamboo,[2] dead bushes,[3] poisonous potatoes[4] and chorus plant products.[5] Meat items, fish, and bones are also not compostable.[6]
Interacting with a Composter while holding a Debug Stick will raise the level by one, the debug stick is not consumed.

Profession[edit | edit source]
Main article: Job site block
If a composter has not been claimed by a villager, any nearby unemployed villager has a chance to change their profession to farmer and claim the composter as their job site block. Also, farmer villagers can use composter to compost.[8]
Redstone component[edit | edit source]
See also: Redstone circuit
A composter can act as a power source for a redstone comparator. With a composter behind it (either directly, or separated by an unpowered solid block), a comparator outputs a signal strength between 0 and 8, proportional to how full the composter is: 0 for empty, 1 for 1⁄7 full, 2 for 2⁄7 full, and so on to 6. 7 is for completely full but the bone meal is not ready to collect, and 8 for completely full and the bone meal is ready to collect. However, if there is a block between the composter and comparator, the comparator does not immediately update.
Hoppers[edit | edit source]
Composters can interact with hoppers. A hopper directly below a composter pulls bone meal from it. A hopper or dropper facing downward directly above a composter pushes items into it. See Hopper § Redstone component for more details.
Hoppers cannot interact with the sides of a composter.
Fuel[edit | edit source]
A composter can be used as fuel in a furnace to smelt 1.5 items.
Note blocks[edit | edit source]
Composters can be placed under note blocks to produce ""bass"" sounds.

Trivia[edit | edit source]
The compost texture is based on the podzol texture.
If planting crops specifically for composting, potatoes produce somewhat more than beets, carrots, or wheat. However, melons offer nearly the same yield per field space, and do not require replanting after harvest.

Usage[edit | edit source]
Main article: Compound
Using the compound creator opens up a 3×3 grid, where elements can be inserted to create compounds. By inputting the appropriate type and number of elements, the creator outputs the component in the slot to the right of the grid. All compound recipes are shapeless, and unlike the crafting table, the stack sizes are taken into consideration. Also, unlike with most blocks with an interface, the elements are not consumed.

Post-generation[edit | edit source]
Concrete powder becoming solid concrete on contact with water. Notice the sand block falls through the water, while the concrete powder instantly solidifies on contact with water. (Click for bigger image)
Concrete is formed when concrete powder comes into contact with a block of water (source block, flowing or waterlogged). If next to a waterlogged block, it must be adjacent to the sides where water can flow out from, such as the open sides of stairs, but not the back side of stairs or any sides of waterlogged leaves.
Renewability[edit | edit source]
Concrete is renewable as all of the crafting ingredients of concrete powder are renewable. However, without glitches, sand is only renewably obtained through the wandering trader, which spawns infrequently and only allows a limited number of trades per spawn, making it impractical to obtain it (and by extension, concrete) through only renewable means.
Usage[edit | edit source]
The bright and solid colors of concrete make it useful for decoration. It has more pronounced colors than terracotta, and unlike wool, is not flammable.
As a building material, its hardness is slightly higher than stone, but its blast resistance is significantly lower.[1]
Note blocks[edit | edit source]
Concrete can be placed under note blocks to produce ""bass drum"" sound.

January 27, 2017 Jeb states that this is actually a new block, clearing popular rumors that the hardened clay texture was being changed.
February 2, 2017 Jeb tweeted a video (archived) that showed concrete powder turning into a non-falling block when in water. This ""wet"" form of the block is concrete, though they were not confirmed to be the same at the time.
Jeb later added that 16 different colors are available.[2]

Trivia[edit | edit source]
In real life, a 1-cubic-meter concrete block (the size of a Minecraft block) is practically blast-proof, while the blast resistance of concrete in Minecraft is quite low.
Also in real life, concrete is made of Portland cement, apart from sand, gravel, and water. Cement serves as a binding material, that binds sand and gravel together. In Minecraft, dye is used instead of cement. It is possible that cement is made at the same time from sand and gravel, if the gravel contains limestone, because limestone and sand are real life ingredients for cement.
A black concrete block is considered the blackest block in Minecraft.

Red sand cannot be used in place of sand.[1][2]







Renewability[edit | edit source]
Concrete powder is renewable as all of its crafting ingredients are themselves renewable. However, without glitches, sand is only renewably obtained through the wandering trader, which spawns infrequently and only allows a limited number of trades per spawn. Therefore concrete powder is more easily obtained by simply harvesting sand from any biome it generates in.
Usage[edit | edit source]
Normal sand falls through the water, while one of the pink concrete powder blocks solidifies immediately on contact with the water.
Concrete powder falls when there is a non-solid block beneath it.
Creating concrete[edit | edit source]
Main article: Concrete
If a concrete powder block comes into contact with water, it solidifies into a block of concrete. Specifically, the block has to be placed into, placed next to, or fall into flowing water, a water source block, or a waterlogged block. If placed next to a waterlogged block, it must be adjacent to the sides where water can flow out from, such as the open sides of stairs, but not the back side of stairs or any sides of waterlogged leaves. It does not solidify in midair falling past water. If it lands next to water, it solidifies only after a block update. Rain or splash water bottles also have no effect on concrete powder. Concrete powder in item form also does not become concrete. Concrete powder placed directly at water makes the placement sound of concrete.
Note blocks[edit | edit source]
Concrete powder can be placed under note blocks to produce ""snare drum"" sound.

Falling block entity[edit | edit source]
Main article: Falling Block
Falling Block
Hitbox size
Height: 0.98 blocks
Width: 0.98 blocks
[NBT Compound / JSON Object] Dynamic block entity data
Tags common to all entities[show]
[NBT Compound / JSON Object] BlockState: The falling block represented by this entity.
[String] Name: The resource location of the block.
[NBT Compound / JSON Object] Properties: Optional. The block states of the block.
[String] Name: The block state name and its value.
[Byte] CancelDrop: 1 or 0 (true/false) - true if the block should be destroyed instead of placed after landing on a solid block. When true, the block is not dropped as an item, even if the DropItem tag is set to true. However, if the entity is deleted due to its Time value being too high, this tag is ignored and an item is dropped depending on the DropItem tag. CancelDrop defaults to 1 for falling suspicious sand and suspicious gravel, and 0 for the other vanilla falling blocks and any summoned falling block.
[Byte] DropItem: 1 or 0 (true/false) – true if the block should drop as an item when it breaks. Any block that does not have an item form with the same ID as the block does not drop even if this is set.
[Float] FallHurtAmount: Multiplied by the FallDistance to calculate the amount of damage to inflict. By default this value is 2HP for anvils, and 6HP for pointed dripstone.
[Int] FallHurtMax: The maximum hit points of damage to inflict on entities that intersect this falling block. For vanilla falling blocks, always 40HP × 20.
[Byte] HurtEntities: 1 or 0 (true/false) – true if the block should hurt entities it falls on. Defaults to 1 for anvils and pointed dripstone and to 0 for the other vanilla falling blocks and any summoned falling block.
[NBT Compound / JSON Object] TileEntityData: Optional. The tags of the block entity for this block.
[Int] Time: The number of ticks the entity has existed. When Time goes above 600, or above 100 while the block is at Y=-64 or is outside building height, the entity is deleted.

Breaking[edit | edit source]
A conduit drops as an item when broken with any tool or by hand, but a pickaxe is the fastest way to break it.
Like other precious blocks such as beacons and shulker boxes, it always drops when destroyed by an explosion.

Schematic of a conduit in an activation frame. Click the scale on the right to view the layers. The conduit and water are required. The frame must include 16-42 blocks of prismarine, dark prismarine, sea lanterns, and/or prismarine bricks. Unused frame-blocks and empty spaces can be anything.
When activated, conduits give the ""Conduit Power"" effect to all players in contact with rain or water, within a spherical range of 32-96 blocks. This effect restores oxygen, gives underwater night vision and increases mining speed by 16.7% (1/6th). Conduits also damage any hostile mobs, like drowned, guardians, and elder guardians, within a range of 8 blocks of the conduit. Conduits can be activated in any biome and at any height or depth.
To activate, a conduit needs to be in the center of a 3×3×3 volume of water (26 source blocks, flowing water, and/or waterlogged blocks, with the conduit in the center), which must be enclosed within an activation frame. The frame can be built out of blocks in three 5×5 open squares centered on the conduit, one around each axis. Only prismarine, dark prismarine, prismarine bricks, and sea lantern blocks in the frame contribute to activation. A minimum of 16 blocks are required and produce an effective range of 32 blocks. Prismarine-type slabs (including double slabs), stairs, and walls cannot be used to activate the conduit. Any blocks (of any type) that are not part of the activation frame itself but are in the 5×5×5 outer shell likewise have no effect. Once activated, removing any blocks from the conduit (frame blocks) deactivates the conduit.[note 1]
The effective radius of the conduit is 16 blocks for every seven blocks in the frame, though the effect does not activate until the minimum of 16 blocks is included in the build. Thus, it extends to 48 at 21 blocks, 64 at 28 blocks, 80 at 35 blocks, and 96 with a complete frame of 42 blocks. When the frame is complete, the center of the conduit displays an orange iris-like shape.
Attacking mobs[edit | edit source]
A complete frame also carries the additional advantage of damaging hostile mobs within 8 blocks of the conduit, dealing 4HP magic damage every 2 seconds, if they are in contact with water or rain.[note 2]

Trivia[edit | edit source]
When it is activated, the conduit displays the heart of the sea's texture in the center of its model. However, when all 42 blocks have been placed (when the conduit is fully activated) the heart opens like an orange eye.
The achievement obtained by activating a conduit refers to the system of whirlpools in Nordland county, Norway.

A copper bulb is a light-emitting block. It toggles on or off when it receives a redstone pulse, and does not need continuous power to emit light. Its light level depends on its state of oxidation.
Waxed copper bulbs do not oxidize, but otherwise function identically.

Usage[edit | edit source]
Copper bulbs can be activated to emit light, with the light level emitted decreasing for each stage of oxidation. When the copper bulb receives a redstone pulse, it instantly toggles between its lit and unlit states.
Redstone component[edit | edit source]
A comparator can read the state of a copper bulb, and it emits a signal strength of 15 if the bulb is lit, regardless of oxidation. If the bulb is unlit, the comparator does not emit any power, allowing this comparator and copper bulb combination to act as a compact T flip-flop.
While the copper bulb is receiving redstone power (either to toggle the bulb on or off) a red dot appears in the center of the block. An observer can detect this, and emits a signal when a copper bulb becomes powered or unpowered.
Oxidation[edit | edit source]
Main article: Oxidation
Non-waxed copper bulbs have four stages of oxidation (including the initial normal state). Lightning bolts and axes can remove the oxidation on copper bulbs. They can be waxed with honeycomb to prevent oxidation from progressing.
As the block begins to oxidize (exposed), it gets discolored and green spots begin to appear. As the oxidation continues (weathered), the block is a green color with brown spots. In the last stage (oxidized), the block is teal with several green spots.
The light level emitted by copper bulbs also changes depending on the stage of oxidation.

Breaking[edit | edit source]
A copper door can be mined with anything, but pickaxes are the fastest. Pistons can also break doors by pushing the piston head or any block into the door.
Copper doors require a solid block beneath them for support. If that block is removed, the door breaks and drops itself.

Natural generation[edit | edit source]
Copper doors generate naturally between the rooms of trial chambers.
Usage[edit | edit source]
Main article: Door § Usage
Copper doors can be opened and closed using a redstone signal, or by players, villagers[1], piglins, wandering traders‌[BE only], vindicators‌[JE only]. Copper doors are also affected by the wind burst of thrown wind charges, causing them to open if closed, or vice versa.
In Hard difficulty, copper doors can be broken by vindicators and all variants of zombies except drowned.
Barrier[edit | edit source]
A vindicator breaking a closed copper door placed sideways, even though it allows passage
A copper door can be opened or closed by pressing the Use Item/Place Block control. When a door opens or closes, it immediately changes its orientation without affecting anything in the space it ""swings through"".
Some zombies can break copper doors in Hard difficulty. Zombies have a 5% chance to spawn with the ability to break doors. Vindicators spawned from a raid in Normal and Hard difficulty can also break copper doors, but they do so only to reach targeted players, villagers, or wandering traders. In Java Edition, some vindicators may sometimes open a copper door instead of breaking it. Both zombies and vindicators attempt to break a copper door only when the door is in its ""closed"" state; this is the case even when the door is placed in such a way as to allow passage in its ""closed"" state and block passage in its ""open"" state (for example, by facing sideways when placing the door).
Redstone component[edit | edit source]
See also: Redstone circuit
Copper doors can be controlled with redstone power.
A copper door is a redstone mechanism component and can be activated by weakly powering any cardinally adjacent block.
When activated, the copper door immediately opens. When deactivated, it immediately closes. Players and mobs can still open and close a door that is controlled by a redstone signal.
All methods of activating a door can be applied to either the top or bottom parts of a door.
Oxidation[edit | edit source]
Main article: Oxidation
Non-waxed copper doors have four stages of oxidation (including the initial normal state).[2] Lightning bolts and axes can remove the oxidation on copper doors. They can be waxed with honeycomb to prevent oxidation from progressing.
As the block begins to oxidize (exposed), it gets discolored and green spots begin to appear. As the oxidation continues (weathered), the block is a green color with brown spots. In the last stage (oxidized), the block is teal with several green spots.
Air pockets[edit | edit source]
Copper doors can be used as air pockets underwater in Java Edition. They can also be used as air pockets in lava in both Java and Bedrock editions, similarly to iron doors.

Waxed copper grates of various oxidization stages generate naturally within the corridors of trial chambers, mostly serving as wall-mounted walkways between different rooms. They are also featured on some walls and floors and can form dead ends within the halls, mostly with a chest in front.

Usage[edit | edit source]
Copper grates are decorative semi-transparent blocks that can oxidize. Copper grates do not conduct redstone, and mobs cannot spawn on top of them. They can also be waterlogged, and smoke travels through them.
Copper grates adjacent to other copper grates are invisible when viewed through a copper grate that is identical in states of oxidation and wax.
Oxidation[edit | edit source]
Main article: Oxidation
Non-waxed copper grates have four stages of oxidation (including the initial normal state). Lightning bolts and axes can remove the oxidation on copper grates. Using a honeycomb on a copper grate prevents it from oxidizing.
As the block begins to oxidize (exposed), it gets discolored and green spots begin to appear. As the oxidation continues (weathered), the block is a green color with brown spots. In the last stage (oxidized), the block is teal with several green spots.

Trivia[edit | edit source]
Copper grates were mainly inspired by chain link fences.[1]
In Java Edition 23w13a_or_b, a block called ""copper spleaves"" was added, having a very similar appearance to the copper grates. Nevertheless, the two blocks are unrelated.[1]

Obtaining[edit | edit source]
Breaking[edit | edit source]
Copper ore must be mined with a stone pickaxe or better, otherwise it drops nothing.
Breaking copper ore drops 2-5 raw copper, unless mined with a Silk Touch pickaxe. It is affected by the Fortune enchantment, dropping up to 20 raw copper, or 7.7 raw copper on average with Fortune III.

Natural generation[edit | edit source]
See also: Ore (feature)
Copper ore can be generated anywhere on the Overworld in the form of ore blobs. Copper ore generate in two batches, the first batch generate anywhere on the overworld biomes except dripstone caves 16 times per chunks in groups from 0 to 16, in layer -16 to 112, being most common in layers 47 and 48 and less common at the ends. The second batch generate only in dripstone caves 16 times per chunks in groups from 0 to 52, in layer -16 to 112, being most common in layers 47 and 48 and less common at the ends.
Copper ore can replace stone, andesite, diorite, granite, tuff, and deepslate. Copper ore that replaces tuff or deepslate becomes deepslate copper ore.
It can also spawn rare ore veins above Y=0, mixed with granite and the occasional raw copper blocks. In dripstone caves biomes, copper ore veins are larger on average.
Usage[edit | edit source]
Copper ore is smelted to obtain copper ingots, which are crafting ingredients for blocks of copper, spyglasses, and lightning rods. Copper ore does not weather like its block counterpart, though the ore itself shows some oxidation.

Block of Copper

Usage[edit | edit source]
A copper sink can be filled with water by using a water bucket on the sink. Interacting with a filled sink using a bucket empties the sink and fills the bucket. Bottles cannot be used on the copper sink, nor can buckets with other liquids.
Dropping any exclusively copper-based item into the sink deletes the item, including Raw Copper, Copper Ingot, Block of Copper, and other copper sinks.

Trivia[edit | edit source]
The copper sink block is a joke referring to the Minecraft community's request that Mojang add a copper ""sink"" (in video game development language, a ""sink"" refers to a gameplay feature that requires constant resource investment, preventing players from hoarding resources), as copper ingots have few uses compared to other similar items like iron ingots.

Trivia[edit | edit source]
Name ""Copper Spleaves"" is a reference to the Minecraft minigame spleef. Spleef is a competitive minigame played within Minecraft. When playing spleef, players destroy blocks below other players, allowing them to fall off the playing field and into a pit. The object of the game is to be the last player on the field. Because of this, the name of the Copper Spleaves is a combination of the words ""Spleef"" and ""Leaves"".[citation needed]
The exact y level the player needs to be in to not break the copper spleaves is just less than 1 above the block.
Copper spleaves have only a weathered texture, despite being a copper block.
In 1.21 a similar block named ""copper grates"" has been added, having a similar appearance to copper spleaves.

Usage[edit | edit source]
Main articles: Trapdoor § Usage and Tutorials/Trapdoor uses
Copper trapdoors can be opened and closed by players or a redstone signal. Copper trapdoors are also affected by the wind burst of thrown wind charges, causing them to open if closed, or vice versa.
Barrier[edit | edit source]
A copper trapdoor can be opened or closed by pressing the Use Item/Place Block control.
Redstone component[edit | edit source]
Copper trapdoors can be controlled with redstone power. When activated, the copper trapdoor immediately opens. When deactivated, it immediately closes.
An activated copper trapdoor can still be closed by a player, and does not re-open until it receives a new activation signal (if a trapdoor has been closed ""by hand"", it still needs to be deactivated and then reactivated to open by redstone).
Oxidation[edit | edit source]
Main article: Oxidation
Non-waxed copper trapdoors have four stages of oxidation (including the initial normal state). Lightning bolts can remove the oxidation on copper trapdoors. However, axes cannot be used in the same way they can with other copper blocks (because right clicking on non-waxed copper trapdoors while holding an axe only toggles the trapdoor). Instead, copper trapdoors must be right-clicked with an axe while crouching to deoxidize them. They can be waxed with honeycomb to prevent oxidation from progressing.
As the block begins to oxidize (exposed), it gets discolored and green spots begin to appear. As the oxidation continues (weathered), the block is a green color with brown spots. In the last stage (oxidized), the block is teal with several green spots.

Natural generation[edit | edit source]
Coral naturally generates in coral reef structures found in warm ocean biomes.
Post-generation[edit | edit source]
When using bone meal on dirt, coarse dirt, sand, red sand, gravel, or clay in warm ocean biomes, coral generates in place of some of the seagrass in a 5 X 5 area. In Bedrock Edition, the same can happen in any biomes as long as bone meal is used in a water source above the aforementioned solid blocks.
Usage[edit | edit source]
Coral can be used as a building or decoration block.
Placement[edit | edit source]
In order for coral to stay alive, at least one of the blocks surrounding it must be water or a waterlogged block. If placed outside of water, it dies and transforms into its respective dead coral after 3 to 4.95 seconds‌[Java Edition only] or 2 to 9.95 seconds‌[Bedrock Edition only]. Coral dies even when the game rule randomTickSpeed is set to 0.[1] Once a coral turns into its dead variant, it is not possible to turn it back into a live variant.
Note Blocks[edit | edit source]
All types of coral can be placed under note blocks to produce ""bass drum"" sounds.

Example
Schematic of valid block placements for coral blocks
with water around. Several ways are shown where the
arrangement would cause coral blocks to stay alive
or die.
Coral blocks can be used for building or as decoration blocks.
Placement[edit | edit source]
In order for a coral block to stay alive, at least one of the six directly adjacent blocks must be water or a waterlogged block. If placed outside of water, it transforms into its respective dead coral block after 3 to 4.95 seconds‌[Java Edition only] or 2.25 seconds‌[Bedrock Edition only] — a grayscale version of the coral block. A coral block still dies if the game rule randomTickSpeed is set to 0.[1] Once a coral block dies, it is not possible to turn a dead coral block into a live coral block.
In Bedrock Edition, coral blocks do not die if they are surrounded by any non-air blocks.[2]
Sea pickle farm blocks[edit | edit source]
If sea pickles are planted on live coral blocks, using bone meal on the sea pickles increases the number of sea pickles and creates more sea pickles on nearby coral blocks. Specifically, they can spread to the original sea pickle's level or one level below, out to a horizontal taxicab distance of 2. This only works on living coral blocks, not dead coral blocks.
Note Blocks[edit | edit source]
All types of coral blocks can be placed under note blocks to produce ""bass drum"" sounds.

Natural generation[edit | edit source]
Coral fans naturally generate in coral reef structures.
Post-generation[edit | edit source]
Bone meal[edit | edit source]
When bone meal is used in warm ocean biomes, it has a chance of generating coral fans.
Wall Coral Fans[edit | edit source]
Wall coral fans cannot be obtained through vanilla means in Bedrock Edition except through add-ons or inventory editing, though the item form is badly glitched to the point of being completely nameless.
Usage[edit | edit source]
Coral fans can be used for building or as decoration blocks.
Placement[edit | edit source]
All coral fans can be placed on the four sides and the top surface of blocks; they cannot be placed on the bottom surface.
Water[edit | edit source]
In order for coral fans to stay alive, they must be placed in water. In Java Edition, coral fans can also be placed outside of water as long as one of the blocks surrounding it contains water. If placed outside of water, they transform into their respective dead coral fan immediately‌[Bedrock Edition only] or after 3 to 4.95 seconds‌[Java Edition only]. Once a coral fan dies, it is not possible to turn a dead coral fan back into a live coral fan.
Pushing with pistons[edit | edit source]
Live coral fans cannot be pushed by pistons (attempting to do so results in the coral fan breaking).

Breaking[edit | edit source]
A cornflower can be broken instantly with any item or by hand, dropping itself.
A cornflower also breaks if water or lava runs over its location, if a piston extends or pushes a block into its location, or if a block under the plant is moved or destroyed.

Natural generation[edit | edit source]
Cornflowers generate naturally on dirt and grass blocks in plains, sunflower plains, flower forest, and meadow biomes as part of vegetation features. In Java Edition, they are also technically capable of growing in dripstone caves and deep dark biomes, though it is very unlikely due to lack of grass blocks in these biomes. In flower forests and meadows, cornflowers only generate as part of gradients.
Natural cornflowers are also found in plains villages.
Post-generation[edit | edit source]
Main article: Flower § Post-generation
Java Edition[edit | edit source]
When bone meal is applied to a grass block in a plains, sunflower plains, flower forest, meadow, dripstone caves, or deep dark biome, cornflowers have a chance of generating on the targeted block and adjacent grass blocks in a 15×5×15 area. In meadows and flower forests, cornflowers can generate only in specific locations depending on the flower gradient. In plains, sunflower plains, dripstone caves, and the deep dark, cornflowers cannot generate in tulip-only areas.
Bedrock Edition[edit | edit source]
When bone meal is applied to a grass block in a plains, sunflower plains, or flower forest biome, cornflowers have a chance of generating on the targeted block and adjacent grass blocks in a 7×5×7 area. In flower forests, cornflowers can generate only in specific locations depending on the flower gradient. In plains and sunflower plains, cornflowers cannot generate in tulip-only areas.
When bone meal is applied to a cornflower that has been placed on top of a grass block in any biome, more cornflowers appear on top of nearby grass blocks. The flowers can appear up to 3 blocks away from the original, forming a 7×7 square.
Mob loot[edit | edit source]
In Java Edition, endermen can pick up cornflowers, like any other one-block-tall flower, and drop it if killed while holding it.
Trading[edit | edit source]
Wandering traders may sell a cornflower for a single emerald.
Usage[edit | edit source]
Main article: Flower § Usage
Like other flowers, cornflowers can be used as decoration and planted on grass blocks, dirt, coarse dirt, rooted dirt, farmland, podzol, mycelium, moss blocks, mud, or muddy mangrove roots.
Cornflowers can also be placed in flower pots.

Bees[edit | edit source]
Bees engage in a pollinating behavior with cornflowers, increasing the honey level in beehives and bee nests by 1.
Breeding[edit | edit source]
Cornflowers can be used to breed, grow, and lead bees.
Bee nests[edit | edit source]
Oak, birch, and cherry trees grown from saplings that are within 2 blocks of a cornflower have a 5% chance to grow with a bee nest and 2-3 bees in it.
Composting[edit | edit source]
Placing a cornflower into a composter has a 65% chance of raising the compost level by 1. A stack of cornflowers yields an average of 5.94 bone meal.

Natural generation[edit | edit source]
Corrupted peelgrass blocks naturally generate throughout the surface of the Potato dimension as the ground of corruption and wasteland biomes.
Post-generation[edit | edit source]
Corrupted peelgrass can spread to nearby terre de pomme blocks and normal peelgrass blocks, just like grass spreads to dirt (although normal peelgrass can't spread to corrupted peelgrass). Additionally, using corrupted potato peels on terre de pomme turns it to corrupted peelgrass.
Usage[edit | edit source]
Farming[edit | edit source]
Using a hoe on a corrupted peelgrass block turns it into poison farmland. Potatoes can grow on corrupted peelgrass blocks without the need of tilling them.
Paths[edit | edit source]
Using a shovel on a corrupted peelgrass block turns it into a poison path.
Peeling[edit | edit source]
Using a potato peeler on a corrupted peelgrass block turns it into terre de pomme, and drops corrupted potato peels.
Sheep[edit | edit source]
When a sheep eats a corrupted peelgrass block, the block turns into terre de pomme, and a sheared sheep regrows its wool. Sheep also receives Poison for 1 second, but the duration is too short to actually deal any damage to the mob. Baby sheep graze corrupted peelgrass much more often than adults and mature 1 minute faster when grazing.

Trivia[edit | edit source]
""Cracked Polished Blackstone Bricks"" is the current longest name for a block (excluding Minecraft Education), tied with ""Polished Blackstone Pressure Plate"" (34 characters with spaces, 31 without)
It briefly lost its place between Java Edition 1.17 snapshots 20w45a and 21w05a, where it was surpassed by variants of the copper block:
Waxed Lightly Weathered Cut Copper Stairs (41 characters with spaces, 36 without in first place)
Waxed Lightly Weathered Cut Copper Slab (39 characters with spaces, 34 without in second place)
Waxed Semi-Weathered Cut Copper Stairs (38 characters with spaces, 34 without in third place)
Waxed Semi-Weathered Cut Copper Slab (36 characters with spaces, 32 without in fourth place)
The record holders in the Minecraft Education are ""Hardened Light Blue Stained Glass Pane"" and ""Hardened Light Gray Stained Glass Pane"" (both at 38 with spaces, 33 without).

  11 STONE
A crafter is a low-capacity storage block used for automated crafting. Its inventory acts as a crafting table that crafts when it is powered, ejecting the crafted item (or items) from its ""mouth"" into the world or into a container it is facing. Its inventory slots can be individually locked to prevent hoppers, droppers, etc. from filling them; crafting recipes treat locked slots as empty of items.

Usage[edit | edit source]
In Java Edition, crafters cannot be moved by pistons.
The crafter's GUI in Java Edition.
A simple contraption for crafting cake using the crafter
Container[edit | edit source]
A crafter has nine slots of inventory space, arranged in a 3-by-3 grid like a crafting table. Its GUI can be accessed by using it.
A slot can be enabled or disabled, which can be toggled by clicking on it when empty. Disabled slots cannot have items put in them.
Hoppers, droppers and other crafters interact with crafters by inserting items into its inventory; hoppers can remove ingredients as well. The added items are distributed from the top left to the bottom right of the enabled slots if there is an empty slot, if the crafter has all item slots filled then items are added to the lowest count item stack of the same type.[1] Hoppers and droppers can interact with all sides of the crafter, and prioritize filling empty spaces, followed by the smallest stack of the item.
Redstone component[edit | edit source]
When a crafter receives a redstone signal, it waits for 2 redstone ticks (4 game ticks, or 0.2 seconds barring lag) before ejecting one crafted item using the ingredients from the nine inventory slots. The crafted items are subsequently ejected from the front of the crafter. If the front of a crafter is facing a container (including another crafter), the crafted items are transferred into the container. If the container it is facing is full, or the item cannot be inserted into the container, the crafter ejects the item instead. Crafters interact with containers similar to droppers. If a recipe has byproducts (e.g. empty bottles for honey blocks or empty buckets for cake) those are ejected after the crafted item.
For shaped recipes, the position of the items in the inventory matters. Because disabled slots prevent items from entering the slot, crafters can be used to craft any item in the game automatically without any input from the player, using a series of hoppers and/or droppers and the correct configuration of disabled slots for the recipe.
A hopper placed below a crafter collects the ingredients from the crafting grid, not the resulting item.
In Java Edition, unlike dispensers and droppers, crafters aren't affected by quasi-connectivity.[2]
Comparators can emit a redstone signal when reading from a crafter. The signal strength is equal to the number of crafting slots that are either disabled or occupied by an item. [3] The stack size of the item has no effect on the comparators output signal e.g. having 1 stick in a slot vs having 64 sticks in that same slot both output the same comparator signal. An empty crafter with no disabled slots does not output any signal through a comparator. A crafter with every slot being disabled or containing an item (of any stack size) outputs a signal strength of nine through a comparator.

Block data[edit | edit source]
A crafter has a block entity associated with it that holds additional data about the block.
Java Edition:
See also: Block entity format
[NBT Compound / JSON Object] Block entity data
Tags common to all block entities[show]
[Int] crafting_ticks_remaining: Set to 6 when the crafter crafts something.[more information needed]
[Boolean] triggered: Set to 1 when it is powered. It is otherwise 0.
[Int Array] disabled_slots: Indexes of slots that are disabled.
[NBT List / JSON Array] Items: List of items in this container.
[NBT Compound / JSON Object]: An item in the crafter, including the slot tag. Crafter slots are numbered 0-8. 0 starts in the top left corner.
Tags common to all items[show]
[String] Lock: Optional. When not blank, prevents the container from being opened unless the opener is holding an item whose name matches this string.
[String] LootTable: Optional. Name of the loot table to use. If this is used in a chest-like container, the loot table generates its content when it is opened. Generating the items in the container removes both loot table tags ([String] LootTable and [Long] LootTableSeed).Is not preserved when removed.[upcoming JE 1.21.5]
[Long] LootTableSeed: Optional. Seed for generating the loot table. The default value works similarly to the seeds for worlds, where value of 0 or an omitted value causes the game to use a random seed.

Natural generation[edit | edit source]
Crafting tables naturally generate in witch huts, igloos, trail ruins, tents outside pillager outposts, in trial chambers (a hidden chamber inside of the ""Intersection 2"" room), and in some small village houses - only in savanna, desert and taiga villages.

Usage[edit | edit source]
Placement[edit | edit source]
Regardless of the player's position during placement, the different textures of the block are always facing in the same position (the textures with the saws are facing west and north, while the one with the crafting grid is facing up).
Crafting[edit | edit source]
The GUI of the crafting table.
Main article: Crafting
Pressing use on a crafting table opens the 3×3 crafting grid that allows the player to craft many more items than are available with the crafting grid in the inventory, which is only 2×2.
The recipe book is available to the left of the crafting grid (collapsed by default in Java Edition, expanded by default in Bedrock Edition), which stores crafting recipes for reference and one-click crafting.
Fuel[edit | edit source]
Crafting tables can be used as a fuel in furnaces, smelting 1.5 items per crafting table.
Repairing[edit | edit source]
Main article: item repair
A crafting table can be used to repair damaged tools, weapons, and armor. When two damaged items of the same material are combined side-by-side in the crafting grid they produce a new item with the sum of the durabilities plus a 5% bonus, with a maximum total of 100% durability for that item. Using this method does not require any experience, but removes any enchantments (like a grindstone) on either or both items except curse enchantments. The only way to retain enchantments is to repair damaged items on an anvil.
Note blocks[edit | edit source]
Crafting tables can be placed under note blocks to produce ""bass"" sounds.

Trivia[edit | edit source]
From version 1.6.1 through version 1.19.4, the application icon for Java Edition was a crafting table. As of version 1.20, the icon for Java Edition is now a grass block (for releases), or a dirt block (for snapshots).
The original inventory screen before January 29, 2010 was the crafting table interface. There were no armor slots, no off-hand slot, no recipe book, nor viewport of the player's skin.
The texture of the crafting table visually features a hammer, saw, and pliers. None of these tools are currently implemented in the game.

A creaking heart is a living block[1][2] that can be crafted or found inside trees in pale gardens. It activates if placed between two pale oak logs; then, during nighttime or thunderstorms, it spawns a creaking and protects it from all damage. Breaking a creaking heart that is protecting a creaking instantly kills it. Hitting a protected creaking causes resin clumps to grow near its linked creaking heart.

Breaking[edit | edit source]
Creaking hearts drop as an item only when mined by a tool enchanted with Silk Touch. Otherwise, they drop 1-3 resin clumps; Fortune can increase the maximum drops by 1 per level (up to 6 with Fortune 3).
Destroying a naturally-generated creaking heart also drops 20-24 experience, only in Survival mode.

Natural generation[edit | edit source]
Creaking hearts occasionally generate inside the top trunks of pale oak trees in the pale garden. Pale oaks grown from their saplings do not generate with hearts.
Crafting[edit | edit source]
Ingredients
[hide]
Crafting recipe
Pale Oak Log +
Block of Resin

Usage[edit | edit source]
A creaking heart can be placed in different orientations, similar to logs. It has two states: disabled and active. The creaking heart is disabled by default, but when properly aligned between two pale oak logs, or any variants of pale oak logs, it becomes active. When a creaking heart becomes active, its texture changes and it appears to be illuminated; although, it does not actually produce light. Removing one of these blocks reverts the heart to disabled if it hasn't already spawned a creaking.
Creaking hearts generate resin clumps on nearby pale oak logs when its linked creaking is attacked by a player. There is a brief cooldown between each resin clump generation.
Spawning mechanics[edit | edit source]
Main article: Creaking § Spawning
A disabled creaking heart (left) and an active creaking heart (right)
Creaking hearts are active during the same times players can sleep, at night (at 12542 ticks in clear weather, when stars appear in the sky, or 12010 ticks in rainy weather) or during a thunderstorm. If an active creaking heart is in the Overworld, it waits 2 ticks (0.1 seconds) and checks if the matching logs are in place. If so and it detects no linked creaking, it tries to find a valid location in a 33×17×33 box centered at that creaking heart to spawn one until successful, interrupted by getting destroyed or disabled. If found, it waits 20 ticks (1 second) before checking again if the matching logs are in place. If successful, it spawns a creaking after 2 extra ticks, otherwise it disables. While a creaking heart is active and has a linked creaking, it does not deactivate until broken, even if any of the matching blocks are removed.
Creaking hearts do not function outside the simulation distance of players.
Valid locations for creakings to spawn at follow these criteria:
The block below must have a solid top surface.
The block below is not leaves.
The location is any non-solid block. This means blocks like carpet can spawn-proof creakings, but not buttons.
The location is where there would be no liquid or other entities' hitboxes within a creaking's hitbox.
Creakings ignore solid blocks within its hitbox that are 2+ blocks above the ground while spawning.
Creaking hearts never spawn creakings in the Nether nor the End.
Despawning creakings[edit | edit source]
Breaking the heart kills its linked creaking and attributes the kill to the player who broke it, adding the kill to their statistics and triggering the Monster Hunter and Monsters Hunted advancements.
During daytime (at 23460 ticks in clear weather, or at 23992 ticks in rainy weather), creaking hearts despawn their linked creakings.
If the heart's linked creaking is too far away, that creaking despawns, and the heart spawns another one if conditions are met.
Redstone component[edit | edit source]
A redstone comparator connected to a creaking heart outputs a signal if the heart has a linked creaking. The strength of the signal depends on the Euclidean distance between the heart and its creaking, and is calculated as follows:
output

Pistons of any kind cannot move creaking hearts.
Ambient sounds[edit | edit source]
A creaking heart emits subtle eerie sounds when it is active and surrounded by any types of logs, stripped logs, wood, or stripped wood in all 6 directions.

If a creeper head is pushed by a piston or comes in contact with water or lava, it breaks off as an item.
When destroyed by an explosion, the creeper head always drops as an item.
Mob loot[edit | edit source]
Creeper heads are always dropped by a creeper if it dies due to a charged creeper's explosion. In Bedrock Edition, if multiple mobs are killed by the same charged creeper, all of them drop their heads, however in Java Edition only one mob selected at random drops its head.[2]
Source Roll Chance Quantity (Roll Chance)
Default Looting I Looting II Looting III
Creeper 100%[d 1] 1 1 1 1
↑ Only dropped when killed by a charged creeper.
Usage[edit | edit source]
Decoration[edit | edit source]
Creeper heads can be oriented in 16 different directions on top of a block, and 4 directions on the sides of blocks, similar to signs. They can be placed on top of, or beside each other by shift clicking.
Wearing[edit | edit source]
See also:  § Renders
The player can wear creeper heads, similarly to pumpkins or helmets. This overlays the second layer of the player's skin.
Disguise[edit | edit source]
Wearing a creeper head reduces the detection range for creepers to 50% of the normal range. This is similar to (and stacks with) the reductions in detection range from sneaking and from the Invisibility status effect.
In Bedrock Edition, wearing a creeper head makes the player invisible to other players on a locator map.
Dispensers[edit | edit source]
A dispenser can equip a creeper head on a player, mob, or armor stand with an empty helmet slot, within the block the dispenser is facing.

Enchantments[edit | edit source]
Creeper heads can receive the following enchantments, but only through an anvil.
Name Max level Method
Curse of Binding I Anvil
Curse of Vanishing I Anvil
Note blocks[edit | edit source]
Placing a creeper head above a note block causes the note block to play the creeper's primed (hissing) sound when activated. This is unlike other mob heads, as creepers don't make ambient sounds.
The block below the note block does not affect the mob sound it creates.

Post-generation[edit | edit source]
Applying bone meal to nylium causes crimson fungi to appear nearby, similar to flowers on grass blocks. While crimson fungi and other Nether vegetation can generate this way, they are more likely to be the same type as the nylium.
Usage[edit | edit source]
Placement[edit | edit source]
All of the blocks that crimson fungi can be placed on.
Crimson fungi may be placed on grass blocks, dirt, coarse dirt, podzol, farmland, rooted dirt, moss blocks, nylium, mycelium, soul soil, mud and muddy mangrove roots. Attempting to place it on any other block fails. Crimson fungi requires a solid block underneath it, and pops off and drops itself if it is no longer supported.
Crimson fungi can also be placed in flower pots.
Growth[edit | edit source]
When bone meal is used on a crimson fungus that is planted on crimson nylium, it has a 40% chance to grow into its tall equivalent (similar to saplings and mushrooms). Crimson fungi grow into huge crimson fungi, respectively. The stem, shroomlight, or wart blocks may replace certain blocks including slabs and torches.
Breeding[edit | edit source]
Crimson fungus can be used to breed hoglins and keep them from despawning, but feeding hoglins does not stop them from attacking the player.
Composting[edit | edit source]
Placing a crimson fungus into a composter has a 65% chance of raising the compost level by 1.

Post-generation[edit | edit source]
Using bone meal on netherrack that is placed next to or adjacent to crimson nylium transforms the netherrack into nylium of that type. Air must be above the netherrack during this process. This transformation can also be done by activating a dispenser with bone meal directly into that netherrack block. If both types of nylium are present, there is an equal chance of either being spread.
Renewability[edit | edit source]
This feature is exclusive to Bedrock Edition. 
As netherrack generates in nether portals spawn floating, using bone meal on netherrack turns them into nylium, making them renewable.
Usage[edit | edit source]
Similar to grass blocks and mycelium, crimson nylium decays (based on random ticks) into netherrack when an opaque block is placed above it. However, unlike grass blocks and mycelium, it does not decay underneath water or lava.[1] It decays when covered with snow.[2]
Like mycelium and podzol, mushrooms can remain on nylium blocks in any light level. Huge mushrooms can be grown by using bone meal on mushrooms planted on nylium.
Crimson Fungi can likewise be grown into huge crimson fungi using bone meal, although the fungus must be placed on the same type of nylium, or the bone meal is never consumed.
Similar to grass blocks, the player can apply bone meal to crimson nylium. This nylium, along with nearby nylium, generates vegetation that occurs in its native biome (crimson nylium generates mostly crimson forest vegetation and warped nylium generates mostly warped forest vegetation), and just like in the native biomes, the opposite type of fungi occassionally generates. The vegetation is generated in a 5×5 area, centered on the nylium block on which bone meal is used.
Note Blocks[edit | edit source]
Crimson nylium can be placed under note blocks to produce ""bass drum"" sounds.

Piglins have a ~8.71% chance (40⁄459) to barter 1–3 crying obsidian when given a gold ingot.
Usage[edit | edit source]
Much like obsidian, crying obsidian is a resilient building block. It has a blast resistance of 1,200 and cannot be destroyed by the ender dragon. On the other hand, crying obsidian cannot be used to create a nether portal frame,[1] and End crystals are unable to be placed on them.
When placed, crying obsidian occasionally produces purple dripping particles, which are purely decorative.

Crying obsidian is used to make the respawn anchor, a block that has the function of letting players respawn in the Nether.

Crying obsidian gives off a light level of 10, which does not melt snow or ice. Its blast resistance distinguishes it from other light-emitting blocks.
Note blocks[edit | edit source]
Crying obsidian can be placed under note blocks to produce the ""bass drum"" sounds.
Piston interactivity[edit | edit source]
Crying obsidian cannot be pushed or pulled by pistons or sticky pistons.

Trivia[edit | edit source]
When it was originally going to be added in Beta 1.3, it was going to act as a way to reset the player’s spawn point and would be crafted using lapis lazuli. When beds were added, they took this role instead. In 1.16 the respawn anchor was added which is crafted with crying obsidian.
According to Brandon Pearce, crying obsidian was added when they wanted to have cracked obsidian for the ruined nether portals. They decided to add it as crying obsidian instead because it was more unique and due to high player demand.[citation needed]
The team considered having crying obsidian be obtained by throwing obsidian through a nether portal, or by having regular obsidian be struck by lightning. However, they chose bartering with piglins as a way to make bartering useful.[7]

Waxing[edit | edit source]
Cut copper can be turned into the respective waxed cut copper by using a honeycomb item on them. Waxed cut copper does not oxidize and are identical to the non-waxed version.
Scraping[edit | edit source]
Using an axe on waxed cut copper turns it into the respective non-waxed cut copper. In addition, using an axe on exposed, weathered, or oxidized cut copper reverts it one stage to regular, exposed, or weathered cut copper respectively.
Lightning strike[edit | edit source]
Non-waxed cut copper is completely deoxidized when struck by lightning, and other non-waxed cut copper nearby is deoxidized randomly.

Oxidation[edit | edit source]
Main article: Oxidation
Non-waxed cut copper has four stages of oxidation (including the initial normal state). Lightning bolts and axes can remove the oxidation on cut copper.
As the block begins to oxidize (exposed), it gets discolored and green spots begin to appear. As the oxidation continues (weathered), the block is a green color with brown spots. In the last stage (oxidized), the block is teal with several green spots.

Oxidation[edit | edit source]
Main article: Oxidation
Non-waxed cut copper slabs have four stages of oxidation (including the initial normal state). Lightning bolts and axes can remove the oxidation on cut copper slabs. They can be waxed with a honeycomb to prevent it from oxidizing.
As the block begins to oxidize (exposed), it gets discolored and green spots begin to appear. As the oxidation continues (weathered), the block is a green color with brown spots. In the last stage (oxidized), the block is teal with several green spots.
Sounds[edit | edit source]
In Bedrock Edition, when a cut copper slab is combined into a double slab, the block's use sound is played.[1]

Breaking[edit | edit source]
A dandelion can be broken instantly with any item or by hand, dropping itself.
A dandelion also breaks if water or lava runs over its location, if a piston extends or pushes a block into its location, or if a block under the plant is moved or destroyed.

Natural generation[edit | edit source]
Dandelions generate naturally on dirt and grass blocks in multiple biomes as part of vegetation features:
Plains
Sunflower Plains
Savanna
Savanna Plateau
Windswept Savanna
Snowy Plains
Meadow
Forest
Flower Forest
Birch Forest
Old Growth Birch Forest
Taiga
Old Growth Pine Taiga
Old Growth Spruce Taiga
Snowy Taiga
Jungle
Bamboo Jungle
Sparse Jungle
Dark Forest
Windswept Hills
Windswept Gravelly Hills
Windswept Forest
River
Frozen River
The following additional biomes are also technically allowed to generate dandelions, although they very rarely or never generate grass blocks on the surface in normal worlds. As a result, dandelions can generate only in edge cases or custom worlds.
Beach
Snowy Beach
Stony Shore
Ocean
Deep Ocean

In jungles, bamboo jungles, sparse jungles, savannas and savanna plateaus, dandelions are twice as common as in other biomes. In flower forests and meadows, dandelions only generate as part of gradients.
Natural dandelions are found in plains and savanna villages. Potted dandelions can also generate in woodland mansions.
Post-generation[edit | edit source]
Main article: Flower § Post-generation
Java Edition[edit | edit source]
When bone meal is applied to a grass block in one of the biomes listed above (except those marked as ‌[Bedrock Edition only]), dandelions have a chance of generating on the targeted block and adjacent grass blocks in a 15×5×15 area. In meadows and flower forests, dandelions can generate only in specific locations depending on the flower gradient. In plains, sunflower plains, dripstone caves, and the deep dark, dandelions cannot generate in tulip-only areas.
Bedrock Edition[edit | edit source]
When bone meal is applied to a grass block in any biome except swamp, pale garden, and flower forest, dandelions have a chance of generating on the targeted block and adjacent grass blocks in a 7×5×7 area. Unlike Java Edition, bone meal can generate dandelions anywhere within a meadow biome. In plains and sunflower plains, dandelions cannot generate in tulip-only areas.
When bone meal is applied to a dandelion in any biome, more dandelions appear on top of nearby grass blocks. Poppies can also occasionally appear, and dandelions can occasionally appear when bone meal is applied to poppies. The flowers can appear up to 3 blocks away from the original, forming a 7×7 square.
Mob loot[edit | edit source]
Endermen can pick up dandelions, like any other one-block-tall flower, and drop it if killed while holding it.

Usage[edit | edit source]
Main article: Flower § Usage
Like other flowers, dandelions can be used as decoration and planted on grass blocks, dirt, coarse dirt, rooted dirt, farmland, podzol, mycelium, moss blocks, mud, or muddy mangrove roots.
Dandelions can also be placed in flower pots.

Suspicious stew[edit | edit source]
Main article: Suspicious Stew
Using a dandelion to make suspicious stew, whether by direct crafting or by feeding a brown mooshroom and then milking it with a bowl, imbues it with a Saturation effect that lasts 0.35 seconds in Java Edition and 0.3 seconds in Bedrock Edition. The Saturation effect restores an additional 7 () hunger and 14 saturation in Java Edition, or 6 () hunger and 12 saturation in Bedrock Edition.

Bees[edit | edit source]
Bees engage in a pollinating behavior with dandelions, increasing the honey level in beehives and bee nests by 1.
Breeding[edit | edit source]
Dandelions can be used to breed, grow, and lead bees and rabbits.
Bee nests[edit | edit source]
Oak, birch, and cherry trees grown from saplings that are within 2 blocks of a dandelion have a 5% chance to grow with a bee nest and 2-3 bees in it.
Composting[edit | edit source]
Placing a dandelion into a composter has a 65% chance of raising the compost level by 1. A stack of dandelions yields an average of 5.94 bone meal.

Natural generation[edit | edit source]
Dark prismarines naturally generate as the main blocks in ocean monuments. Dark prismarine encases the 8 gold blocks in the treasure chamber, and appears in fewer decorative features, compared to the other variants of prismarine.

Usage[edit | edit source]
Conduit power[edit | edit source]
Main article: Conduit
Dark prismarine can be used to activate a conduit by building a structure around it. By doing this, the conduit emits the Conduit Power effect in a certain radius, depending on how many blocks are used to power it. The other two variants of prismarine and sea lanterns can also be used for this purpose.

A daylight detector is a block that outputs a redstone signal based on sunlight.
Using the detector inverts it, causing it instead to output a redstone signal based on the darkness of the sky.

Daylight detectors can be mined by hand or with any tool, but axes are the quickest. Inverted daylight detectors cannot be collected directly; they drop a regular daylight detector. In Bedrock Edition, the inverted sensor may be obtained by using pick block in Creative mode[1], or via inventory editing or add-ons. This appears as tile.daylight_detector_inverted.name in the inventory.

Redstone component[edit | edit source]
Graphed daylight detector output in clear weather.
See also: Redstone circuit
A daylight detector can be used to produce redstone power in proportion to the daylight cycle.
A daylight detector is 0.375 blocks high (3/8ths of a block). Daylight detectors can be moved by pistons.‌[Bedrock Edition only] Water and lava flow around daylight detectors without affecting them.
Placement
To place a daylight detector, use the ""Use Item/Place Block"" control.
A daylight detector can be ""inverted"", which reverses the power levels produced by the daylight detector. To invert a daylight detector, aim at the placed daylight detector and use the ""Use Item/Place Block"" control.
Activation
A daylight detector activates when exposed to sufficient daylight (daylight detector mode) or when exposure to daylight is low enough (inverted daylight detector mode).
Sources of block light (torches, glowstone, etc.) cannot activate a daylight detector.
Behavior
An active daylight detector:
powers adjacent redstone dust, including below it, and redstone comparators facing away from the daylight detector, to a power level that depends on the time of day, the weather, and the internal sky light level (see tables below)
powers adjacent redstone repeaters facing away from the daylight detector to power level 15
activates adjacent redstone mechanisms, including above and below, such as pistons, redstone lamps, etc.
A daylight detector has no effect on other adjacent blocks (for example, it cannot power a block the way a repeater can).
The output signal of daylight detectors in the loaded chunk is updated every 20 gametime‌[JE only]/daytime‌[BE only]. Block updates have no effect on daylight detectors.
Daylight detector[edit | edit source]
The daylight detector power level depends on the time of day, the weather, and the internal sky light level.

Inverted daylight detector[edit | edit source]
Using a daylight detector inverts it. However, the output of the inverted detector is not a simple inversion of the daylight detector's output; it uses a much simpler algorithm that depends only on the internal sky light level. Specifically, it outputs a signal strength of 15 minus the current internal sky light level, where values over 15 or below 0 are taken as 15 or 0 respectively. This means that an inverted daylight detector actually outputs a strength of 11 at midnight when it's clear weather, if it has line of sight with the sky. The effects of shade are applied before inverting, so shade increases the signal strength when it isn't already full, and prevents it from reaching zero.
Fuel[edit | edit source]
Daylight detectors can be used as a fuel in furnaces, smelting 1.5 items per block.
Note blocks[edit | edit source]
Daylight detectors can be placed under note blocks to produce ""bass"" sounds.

Block data[edit | edit source]
A daylight detector has a block entity associated with it which stores only its entity ID and position (the minimum data for a block entity). Although the daylight detector's block entity stores no additional data, the block entity ensures that the daylight detector is updated every game tick.

Axes are considered the preferred tool,[1] and swords would also increase the breaking speed,[2] however these ultimately have no impact due to the instant default mining speed.
Natural generation[edit | edit source]
Dead bushes generate in deserts, badlands, wooded badlands, eroded badlands, swamps, mangrove swamps, old growth pine taigas, and old growth spruce taigas. They generate on sand, red sand, terracotta, grass blocks, podzol, dirt, coarse dirt, and mud.
Dead bushes generate twice as commonly in desert biomes as they do in old growth taigas, and 10 times more often in badlands than they do in deserts (ratio of 1:2:20 – taiga:desert:badlands).
Dead bushes generate in some entrance rooms of trial chambers, next to a cactus. They can also be found inside flower pots inside some desert village houses and in trial chambers.

Usage[edit | edit source]
Dead bushes can be used for aesthetic decoration, as a source of sticks and a fuel source. A dead bush can be placed on any kind of sand, terracotta, dirt, podzol and mud; they can also be placed on grass blocks, mycelium, and moss blocks. They can also be planted in flower pots. Dead bushes do not spread, and cannot be grown using bone meal.
Unlike most plants, dead bushes cannot be composted.[3]
Fuel[edit | edit source]
Dead bushes can be used as fuel in furnaces, smelting 0.5 items per dead bush.
Ambience[edit | edit source]
This section describes content that may be included in Java Edition and Bedrock Edition. 
This content has appeared in Java Edition 1.21.5 and Bedrock Edition 1.21.70 development versions, but the full update containing it has not been released yet.
If placed on sand, red sand or a terracotta block of any kind with at least one more corresponding block underneath it, dead bushes produce ambient sounds reminiscent of dry leaves rustling, wind howling and insects rattling. These ambient sounds can play anywhere if the given conditions are met, and naturally play in the badlands and desert biomes due to the abundance of dead bushes on top of said blocks.

Post-generation[edit | edit source]
Dead coral is created when coral is placed out of water. When live coral is placed outside of water, it dies and transforms into its respective dead coral after 3 to 5 seconds. Coral dies even when the game rule randomTickSpeed is set to 0.[2]
Usage[edit | edit source]
Dead coral can be used as a building or decoration block.
Dead coral cannot be turned back into living coral.
Note blocks[edit | edit source]
All types of dead coral can be placed under note blocks to produce ""bass drum"" sounds.

Trivia[edit | edit source]
On the Legacy Console Edition (except Xbox One and Nintendo Switch), only the live variants of coral are available. This is due to dead coral being added on Bedrock Edition in Bedrock Edition 1.13.0, several weeks after the last final update was released on PlayStation 4.
Although dead coral is unavailable on Legacy Console Edition, dead variants of coral blocks and coral fans are available on the respective platforms with Update Aquatic or newer.

↑ These durations ignore other influential factors (e.g. Mining Fatigue), and are measured in seconds. For more information, see Breaking § Speed.
Natural generation[edit | edit source]
Dead coral block variants‌[Bedrock Edition only] naturally generate in coral reef structures, which can be found in warm oceans. In Java Edition, dead coral blocks do not generate naturally.
Post-generation[edit | edit source]
If a live coral block is placed outside of water, it transforms into its respective dead coral block after a few seconds — a grayscale version of the coral block. A coral block still dies if the game rule randomTickSpeed is set to 0.[1]
Usage[edit | edit source]
Dead coral blocks can be used for building or as decoration blocks. Unlike live coral blocks, dead coral blocks cannot be used for farming sea pickles. It is not possible to turn a dead coral block back into a live coral block.
Note blocks[edit | edit source]

Dead coral fans can be obtained by placing live coral fans outside of water, and it turns into its respective dead variant immediately‌[Bedrock Edition only] or after a few seconds‌[Java Edition only].
Wall dead coral fans[edit | edit source]
Wall dead coral fans cannot be obtained through vanilla means. In Java Edition, they are completely unobtainable, but in Bedrock Edition, they can be obtained through add-ons or inventory editing, though the item form is badly glitched to the point of being completely nameless.
Usage[edit | edit source]
Dead coral fans can be used for building or as decoration blocks. It is not possible to turn a dead coral fan back into a live coral fan.
Placement[edit | edit source]
All dead coral fans can be placed on the four sides and the top surface of blocks; they cannot be placed on the bottom surface.
Pushing with pistons[edit | edit source]
Dead coral fans can be pushed by pistons as long as they are still ""supported"" in the new position (not floating).

A decorated pot is a storage block crafted from bricks and/or pottery sherds, with the items used individually affecting the appearance of its four side faces. It can store a single inventory slot's worth of items, which cannot be seen or retrieved by hand without breaking the pot.

Obtaining[edit | edit source]
Breaking[edit | edit source]
Decorated pots can be broken with any tool and are mined instantly, even when under the Mining Fatigue effect. A decorated pot drops the four pottery sherds or bricks used to craft it when mined with a pickaxe, axe, shovel, hoe or sword not enchanted with Silk Touch. It drops itself when mined with anything else, including tools listed above enchanted with Silk Touch. In either case, the tool does not lose durability.

A decorated pot breaks when hit by one of the following projectiles, causing it to shatter into sherds or bricks:
Arrow
Tipped Arrow
Spectral Arrow
Trident
Firework Rocket
Snowball
Egg
Fireball
Small Fireball
Dragon Fireball
Wither Skull
Wind Charge
A decorated pot also shatters if a player collides with it while flying using elytra boosted by a firework rocket.
A decorated pot drops itself if pushed by a piston. It also always drops itself when destroyed by an explosion, similar to other precious blocks such as beacons and shulker boxes.[1]
Stored items are dropped when the decorated pot is broken, regardless of whether the pot shatters into sherds or drops itself. Breaking a pot is the only way to access the stored items without using a hopper.
In Java Edition, if the cracked block state is set to true, a decorated pot always drops sherds or bricks regardless of the breaking method.
Crafting[edit | edit source]
Ingredients Crafting recipe
[hide]
Description
Any Pottery Sherd or Brick

It is possible to use any combination of bricks and pottery sherds.
The decorated pot's side textures correspond to the item used in the crafting. If a pottery sherd is used, that side bears the texture of that pottery sherd, if a brick is used, that side bears the default texture.
Natural generation[edit | edit source]
Decorated pots naturally generate in trial chambers, with loot inside. Decorated pots in the trial chambers are composed of either four bricks or three bricks and either one flow, guster, or scrape pottery sherd.
Usage[edit | edit source]
Decorated pots can be used for decoration. Due to the top part of the decorated pot having no collision, other blocks can be placed on top of them, including other decorated pots and regular flower pots, which are required to place a flower in the decorated pot.
Pressing the use control on a decorated pot causes it to play a wobble animation, triggering a vibration frequency of 11.
Decorated pots crafted without sherds can also serve as a temporary building block, similar to scaffolding and slime blocks, because they are easy to craft, stack to 64, and can be broken instantly by hand.
Storage[edit | edit source]
A decorated pot can store up to a stack of a single type of item. However, it will fill instantly if an item unstackable like a sword, a filled bucket or potions are stored in it. Unlike other containers, decorated pots have no GUI; items are inserted by interacting with the pot or by using droppers or hoppers. The only way to retrieve stored items is by breaking the pot or by using hoppers and minecarts with hopper.
Decorated pots crafted without sherds can also serve as compact storage for bricks, as they are stackable, each can be crafted from four bricks and can be broken down into four bricks.
A redstone comparator can be used to measure the number of stored items.
Sounds[edit | edit source]
Generic[edit | edit source]
Decorated pots switch to the shattered sounds immediately before breaking when destroyed by a non-Silk Touch tool.

Trivia[edit | edit source]
Decorated pots were originally planned to generate in ancient cities, but the idea was scrapped.
If an item that is not a brick or pottery sherd is applied to the side of a decorated pot using commands, it renders the same pattern as a brick.

(83,100) unique decorated pots that can be crafted, because each of the 4 slots used to craft a pot can be any one of the 23 pottery sherds or a brick, and each pot has 4 symmetric rotations.
The developers consider the decorated pots as a sort of piggy bank because recovering any items stored in it requires breaking the decorated pot.[3]

Obtaining[edit | edit source]
Breaking[edit | edit source]
Deepslate can only be obtained by mining it using a pickaxe with the Silk Touch enchantment, otherwise it drops cobbled deepslate. If broken with any other tool, it drops nothing. The breaking time for deepslate is twice the time for stone.

Natural generation[edit | edit source]
Deepslate makes up the majority of the solid blocks generated below Y=0 in the Overworld. Stone is gradually replaced from Y=8 to Y=0 until it is completely replaced by deepslate.
Deepslate also generates in ancient cities.
Generated loot[edit | edit source]
On ancient_city/city_center/city_center_2, a furnace can generate with 24 deepslate inside of it.
Smelting[edit | edit source]
Deepslate can be smelted from cobbled deepslate.

Post-generation[edit | edit source]
If a world generated before Caves & Cliffs: Part II is loaded after the update, the bedrock layer between Y=0 and Y=4 is replaced with deepslate.
Usage[edit | edit source]
Deepslate can be placed in three orientations, similarly to logs. Silverfish can enter and hide in deepslate, creating an infested block.
Note blocks[edit | edit source]
Deepslate can be placed under note blocks to produce ""bass drum"" sound.

Issues[edit | edit source]
Issues relating to ""Deepslate"" are maintained on the bug tracker. Issues should be reported and viewed there.
Trivia[edit | edit source]
According to Brandon Pearce, the reason for changing the name ""grimstone"" to ""deepslate"" was because the word ""grim"" had too many connotations related to a negative feeling and therefore did not accurately describe the block as to what it actually was. The name ""deepslate"" was eventually chosen because of its location within the world and to more accurately represent that it is a type of slate.[2]
Similar to stone, the orientation of the texture varies depending on the coordinates.

Usage[edit | edit source]
A detector rail can be used as a rail that can detect when minecarts are on it or how full container minecarts on it are.
To place a detector rail, use the Place Block control on the face of a block adjacent to the destination space.
A detector rail can be attached to:
the top of any full solid opaque block (stone, dirt, blocks of gold, etc.), including full-block mechanism components (command blocks, dispensers, droppers, note blocks, and redstone lamps)
the top of a hopper, upside-down slab, or upside-down stairs.
A detector rail cannot be attached to the side or bottom of any block, but attempting to make such an attachment may cause the detector rail to attach to the top of a block under the destination space. For example, if a fence is on the ground, attempting to attach a detector rail to the side of the fence causes the detector rail to be attached to the top of the ground next to the fence instead.
If updated while on an opened trapdoor, a detector rail (or other rails) breaks drops as an item. Placing a minecart on a detector rail on top of a closed and unpowered trapdoor opens the trapdoor and updates it, causing the detector rail to break. If the trapdoor is powered while the minecart is placed, the trapdoor does not open and the rail does not break. The minecart on the detector rail powers the trapdoor and keeps it closed even if the external power source is removed, allowing the detector rail to stay on.
When placed, a detector rail configures itself to line up with any adjacent rails (including activator rails, powered rails, and other detector rails), as well as adjacent rails one block up. If there are two adjacent rails on non-opposite sides, or three or more adjacent rails, a detector rail lines up in the east-west direction. If there are no adjacent rails, a detector rail lines up in the north-south direction (but if a rail is later placed to the east or west, the detector rail re-orients itself in the east-west direction even if it is already connected to another rail to the north or south). If a rail it would line up with is one block up, a detector rail slants upward toward it (with multiple options to slant upward to, a detector rail ""prefers"", in order: west, east, south, and north). Other configurations can be created by placing and removing various rails.
Mobs avoid walking across a detector rail (or other rails), but can be pushed onto them.
It cannot be placed suspended in midair, even with commands.[1]
Rail[edit | edit source]
Main article: Rail
Detector rails (and other rails) act as ""roads"" for minecarts. A minecart that enters a detector rail's space from either end of the detector rail continues to move, losing only a little velocity (which can then be increased again with powered rails). A minecart that enters a detector rail's space from the side turns east or south (depending on the detector rail's orientation), or in the downward direction for a slanted detector rail.
Redstone component[edit | edit source]
Example for signal strength of a full minecart (right) and a half-full one (left)
See also: Redstone circuit
A detector rail activates when any part of any number of minecart's bounding box is in contact with it, and deactivates when no minecarts' bounding box is in contact. The duration of the signal is always a multiple of 10 redstone ticks (although lag or unloading/reloading a chunk might affect this). While active, a detector rail:
powers adjacent redstone dust and adjacent redstone repeaters facing away from the detector rail, to power level 15
powers adjacent redstone comparators facing away from the detector rail to a level corresponding to the fullness of the minecart if it is a minecart with chest or a Minecart with Hopper.
strongly powers any full solid opaque block beneath the detector rail to power level 15
activates any adjacent mechanism components, including above or below, such as pistons, redstone lamps, powered rails, hoppers, etc.
Comparators give a signal for a minecart with chest or a minecart with hopper
If the minecart on the detector rail is a minecart with chest or minecart with hopper, an adjacent redstone comparator facing away from the detector rail outputs a power level proportional to the container's fullness, possibly power level 0. For any other type of minecart (including a regular minecart with a mob riding it) the comparator's output is zero.
A comparator can read the contents of a minecart with hopper or with chest on a detector rail through a solid opaque block, as it can with other container blocks.
Mob interaction[edit | edit source]
Like other types of rails, spiders, cave spiders, and wardens are the only land mobs that can walk onto detector rails.

Diamond ore is a rare ore that generates deep underground, and drops diamonds when mined.
Deepslate diamond ore is a variant of diamond ore that can generate in deepslate and tuff blobs, and is more common than its regular variant.

Obtaining[edit | edit source]
Breaking[edit | edit source]
The diamond ore block itself (rather than its diamond drops) can be obtained by mining it with an iron pickaxe or better, with the Silk Touch enchantment. When mined without Silk Touch, diamond ore drops a single diamond. The maximum number of diamonds dropped from a diamond ore block can be increased with Fortune. Fortune I gives a 1⁄3 chance for 2 diamonds, averaging 1.33 diamonds, Fortune II gives a 25% chance (each) to give 2 or 3 diamonds, averaging 1.75 diamonds, and Fortune III gives a 20% chance (each) to give 2, 3, or 4 diamonds, averaging 2.2 diamonds.

Natural generation[edit | edit source]
See also: Ore (feature)
Ore feature of diamond ore.
Diamond ore generates in the Overworld in the form of ore features, and is more common as the altitude decreases. Diamond ore blocks have a chance to not generate if they are exposed to air; however, they do not have a reduced chance to generate if exposed to water or lava, making them appear more commonly on the walls of aquifers.
Diamond ore generation occurs in four batches:
7 blobs of 1-5 ores per chunk, from Y=14 to Y=-63. There is a 50% chance to not generate an ore block if it is next to air.
1 blob of 1-23 ores every 1⁄9 chunks, from Y=14 to Y=-63. There is a 70% chance to not generate an ore block if it is next to air.
4 blobs of 1-10 ores per chunk, from Y=14 to Y=-63. Ore blocks do not generate if they are next to air.
2 blobs of 1-10 ores per chunk, from Y=-4 to Y=-63. There is a 50% chance to not generate an ore block if it is next to air.
Diamond ore can replace stone, andesite, diorite, granite, tuff, and deepslate. Diamond ore that replaces tuff or deepslate becomes deepslate diamond ore, which is more common than its regular variant because diamond ore is more likely to generate at lower altitudes.
Deepslate diamond ore also generates as part of fossils that generate below Y=0, replacing some of the bone blocks.

Issues relating to ""Diamond Ore"" are maintained on the bug tracker. Issues should be reported and viewed there.
Trivia[edit | edit source]
In some blob formations, ores connect diagonally.
After the Caves & Cliffs update, diamond ore is the only type of Overworld ore that largely keeps the classic ore texture, with only some minor tweaks to coloration.
The Minecraft mechanic that diamond ore replaces coal ore in fossils that generate in deepslate layers, is in accordance with the common misconception in real life that diamonds form from highly compressed coal.
In fact, diamonds mostly form from carbon that comes from carbonate rocks,[3] and are completely unrelated to coal which form from dead plants.

Natural generation[edit | edit source]
See also: Ore (feature)
Diorite can generate in the Overworld in the form of ore blobs.
In Bedrock Edition, diorite attempts to generate in two batches in all biomes in the Overworld. The first batch generate 2 times per chunk in blobs of size 0-864, from elevations 0 to 60. The second batch has 1⁄6 chance to generate blobs of size 0-864, from elevation 64 to 128. In Bedrock Edition, diorite can replace stone, andesite, granite, polished andesite, polished diorite, and polished granite. In Java Edition, diorite can replace stone, andesite, granite, tuff, and deepslate.
Diorite generates in weaponsmith houses, tannery houses, and mason houses in villages in snowy plains.
In Bedrock Edition, diorite generates in coral reefs, replacing some blocks of coral crust.

Issues[edit | edit source]
Issues relating to ""Diorite"" are maintained on the bug tracker. Issues should be reported and viewed there.
Trivia[edit | edit source]
In the real world, diorite comes from underground magma chambers that turned cold. Diorite usually has a salt & pepper appearance.
Andesite is diorite's above-ground equivalent: The two rocks come from the same kind of magma, but andesite forms in lava flows. Its fast cooling is what makes it look smoother than diorite.
Granite is another magma chamber rock, but it's made of more quartz crystals. That is why in Minecraft, granite can be crafted by combining diorite and nether quartz.
In the real world, diorite is an extremely hard rock and is difficult to carve and work with.
In Minecraft: Story Mode, Reuben's grave on Episode 4 is made out of diorite and a new stair variant of it which cannot be found in Minecraft until the Village & Pillage update, which was announced roughly 3 years after Episode 4. It is unknown whether diorite slabs are present.
